<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family:arial;">I guess that this is the day to take political tests... </span></p><p>
<span style="font-family:arial;">The thing to be aware of (as I am sure that you are) is that the questions tend to corral you into the responses that the askers want.

	<p></span><span style="font-family:arial;">Just remember - </span><a href="http://www.sjgames.com/pentabarf"><span style="font-family:arial;">Semper Discordia</span></a><span style="font-family:arial;">!
</span></p><p><span style="font-family:arial;">Took the </span><a href="http://www.theadvocates.org/quiz.html"><span style="font-family:arial;">Worlds Smallest Political Quiz</span></a><span style="font-family:arial;">
</span></p><p><span style="font-family:arial;">The <b><span style="COLOR: rgb(255,0,0)">red dot</span></b> on the Chart shows where I fit on the political map.</span></p><p><span style="font-family:arial;"><img height="352" src="http://www.theadvocates.org/quiz/draw.php?p=10&amp;e=10" width="351" usemap="#quizmap" border="0" /> <map name="quizmap"><area shape="POLY" coords="175,0,263,88,223,127,127,127,88,88" href="http://www.theadvocates.org/quiz/quiz.php#libertarian"></area><area shape="POLY" coords="0,175,88,88,127,127,127,223,88,263" href="http://www.theadvocates.org/quiz/quiz.php#liberal"></area><area shape="POLY" coords="350,175,263,263,223,223,223,127,263,88" href="http://www.theadvocates.org/quiz/quiz.php#conservative"></area><area shape="POLY" coords="175,350,263,263,223,223,127,223,88,263" href="http://www.theadvocates.org/quiz/quiz.php#authoritarian"></area><area shape="RECT" coords="127,127,223,223" href="http://www.theadvocates.org/quiz/quiz.php#centrist"></area></map></p>


	<p></span></p><p><span style="font-family:arial;">Just found </span><a href="http://www.votingcatholic.org/quiz_1.php?session_id=1322300527"><span style="font-family:arial;">this political test</span></a><span style="font-family:arial;">.. It scored me vs the Catholic Bishops, Bush and Kerry. The higher percentage equates to more agreement on this issue.</p>


	<p>Here is my score:</p>


	<p>Overall
Bishops -18%
Bush 9%
Kerry -27%</p>


	<p>Protecting Human Life
Bishops -25%
Bush -25%
Kerry 50%</p>


	<p>Promoting Family Life
Bishops -100%
Bush -100%
Kerry -100%</p>


	<p>Pursuing Social Justice
Bishops 0%
Bush 45%
Kerry -70%</p>


	<p>Pursuing Global Solidarity
Bishops 0%
Bush 100%
Kerry -50%</p>


Wow. Some of those questions and category's are really... um... biased. But what did I expect? Everyone has their axe to grind. </span></p><p><span style="font-family:arial;">-Tsyko</span></p><p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the years, I have been less then perfect about keeping up with people. I am very <em>now</em> oriented, and seem to have a hard time remembering to keep in touch with friends and family from long ago or far away.</p>


	<p>I have never liked this about my self, and have often wished that I could do something about it. I have tried several times, setting up mailing lists and other thing-a-ma-jiggers, however for whatever reason, they never flew.</p>


	<p>So, here is my spot in cyberspace. Ya'll can drop on by and check up on me when ever you want. Please feel free to comment on things that I say. I crave feedback.</p>


	<p>On April 17th, 2004 I married Shela. I made a slide show of some of the digital pictures from before, during and after the wedding. You can view it <a href=http://www.nwgamers.org/wedding.asf>here!</a>. Some of the family has already seen it, but here it is in all of its glory for all of you.</p>


	<p>Quite honestly, Shela and I met during the end of a very dark time in my life. I had just ended a 10-year relationship and marriage on less then friendly terms, and was also reeling from a very hard breakup with some one that was very close to me. She was not ready for a committed relationship, but then again neither was I. I really hope that all of my ex's can find real, deep happiness. That is all that I have really ever wanted for them and me. I think that I have gotten there now and I hope that their journeys there are as swift as possible.</p>


	<p>Shela was like a ray of sunlight at the end of a long tunnel. When I met her, my whole life was starting on an upswing, and she helped me out so much. Her bubbly personality was, and is, just what I need. She also is just as stubborn as I am. We butt heads every once in a while, but that is just part of life. We are both strong personalities, and quite honestly, I would not have it any other way.</p>


	<p>Just about 11 weeks ago, Shela and I made a little Shela and Dukk. Now, a lot of you know me from my 'No Kids, Never No How' phase. Gladly (since one is on the way) I am actually looking forward to this. I think that it is going to be a rewarding experience.</p>


	<p>The pregnancy has been hard on Shela so far, she was on an IV at home for about 3 weeks. Happily, she is back at work now, and glad to be off the couch!</p>

<title>Politics, Media and Personal Safety</title>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The really great thing about living in the US is that we are allowed to have divergent opinions about the political scene. This can give rise to the worst and the best of humanity. I think that this election season has exemplified each of these traits.</p>


	<p>The Barend vs. Kuhl campaign has really shown us the dark underside of political campaigning. It seems that Kuhl was divorced several years ago. This all is happening in New York and under New York law, the records of that are sealed for 100 years to prevent just what is happening.</p>


	<p>Some one went to the Steuben County clerk's office, and asked for the records, claiming to be working on a school project. They were then leaked to the press.</p>


	<p>Now, to the crux of the issue in my mind, the press then decided that this was newsworthy, and started to do story after story about this private matter. Who is to blame? The media for one.</p>


	<p>It seems that they have become untouchable in the past few years. They can say whatever they want, ignore facts that do not jive with their view of the world, and accentuate the parts of a story that further their agenda.</p>


	<p>I do not watch the news anymore. The news is simply scare tactics. All that they want to do is show every bad thing that has happened to people in the past day.</p>


	<p>You know, I am sorry, but I do not really care if a person was murdered by their ex-spouse in littlesburg, anystate. The amount of reporting about crime makes us think that we live in a society that is breaking down, that is totally unsafe.</p>


	<p>This is totally not true.</p>


	<p>According to the <a href="http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/cvictgen.htm"><span class="caps">US DOJ</span></a> there were about 24 million crimes last year.</p>


	<p>Violent victimization and property crime rates in 2001 were the lowest recorded since the <span class="caps">NCVS</span>' inception in 1973. There were about 24 million crimes in 2001.</p>


	<p>According to the US Census, we have about 294,500,000 people right now. You have a 1 in 10 chance of having <span class="caps">ANY</span> crime committed against you, and only 22% of those are violent crimes. So, in 2004 your chances of having a violent crime committed against you were only 1.8% - less then 1 in 50. In 2003 for every 1,000 persons age 12 or older, there occurred 1 rape or sexual assault, 1 assault with injury, and 2 robberies. In 2002 there were only about 6 murder victims per 100,000.</p>


	<p>If we are to believe the media, we live in a period of time that is one of the most unsafe ever. What does that make the 70's, when crime was much higher? We must have been living in a war zone!</p>


	<p>News media lies. It's that simple. Never believe them, as they have stopped being objective and started to report only what they want, to further their agenda. Check out alternate news sources (<a href="http://news.google.com">Google News</a> and <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk">The <span class="caps">BBC</span></a> are two of my favorites) and check the facts.</p>


	<p>Never trust the media.</p>


	<p>Kill your television.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I believe that Tolken meant for his books to be an allegory for life. Many of the darkest portions were written while he served in World War One. His books paint a picture that is very much black and white. We have the soul-wrenching evil of Sauron and the lily-white purity of the Elves and Gandalf.</p>


	<p>Or do we? The real world is all shades of grey, and I believe that he showed us a world where under the surface; all was not as black and white as we would be lead to think. For example, the Elves created the problem (Sauron) and were up and leaving. Gandalf never revealed his true intentions, nor that he more then likely saw what was coming. If he had been up front with the 'forces of good' about what they were going to face, would any of them even left their hearths and homes and ventured out?</p>


	<p>Right now, we face a foe just as determined as Sauron was in the books. Instead of marshaling armies, however, he strikes at our culture, our hearts and minds. Do not mistake his aims; his goal is to remake the world into his image. It would be easier to accept if he invaded countries, marched on cities and waged a conventional war, however he knows that he cannot openly fight us and win.</p>


	<p>The Era of the conventional war is slipping away. No one in the world can stand up to the <span class="caps">USA</span> in a conventional slugging match, and the entire world sees this. Other tactics must be used if these people want to wage war on us and have a chance of winning. The tactics of Terror are the manual for the new war. In essence, our strength has caused the New War.</p>


	<p>Unlikely warriors fight many of the battles outside of the public eye. It can be as simple as extending a truly non-judgmental helping hand to some one in need, or as complex as a Special Forces strike on a safe house to remove the threat of an attack. People are fighting and dying right now to keep you and me safe, and we will never know their names, never even know of the conflict that is happening as we tuck each other into bed at night.</p>


	<p>Mistake me not; this war is going on right now, all over the world, in the shadows. If we are to win it, we must fight with resolve. When force is called for, we must strike hard and fast and never waver. When other options are available to us, we must use them.</p>

<title>Spokane Catholic Diocese declares bankruptcy</title>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yes, you heard it right. Following the precedent set by 2 other Dioceses around the country, the Spokane Catholics have decided that they simply cannot afford to fight all of the allegations against them in court. So, they will chapter 11 and dodge the bullet.</p>


	<p>There are 28 lawsuits right now against the Spokane Diocese, and about 130 claimants. Two priests who worked for the diocese over 30 years ago accounted for about half of those claims. All of these are sexual abuse claims.</p>


	<p>The issue here is not that a priest made a mistake. After all, priests are just men who can make mistakes, and should be held responsible for those mistakes like every one else. The root issue is how the Church handed the issues.</p>


<blockquote>'...drawing attention to Skylstad's relationship with Patrick G. O'Donnell Jr., one of Spokane's most notorious priests. Forced from ministry in the 1980s, O'Donnell abused, by his own admission, at least 30 boys. That admission came out in a recent set of depositions taken as part of the lawsuits, and which were first reported by the Spokesman-Review and Seattle Times. O'Donnell's testimony has provided critics like <span class="caps">SNAP</span> with more information, which, they believe, suggests that Skylstad failed to intervene when he had the chance more than 20 years ago.</blockquote>

	<p>from <a href="http://www.inlander.com/localnews/285553968869587.php">the Inlander</a></p>


	<p>In every instance, there has been evidence of conspiracy, collusion and cover ups by the Church. If a private company, say a daycare, had these allegations raised, no one would raise a stink about lawsuits nor give them any special treatment. However, since this is Religion, here we go.</p>


	<p>To dig down to the essence of the issue, Power corrupts. When ever a 'universal truth' is espoused, this gives the espouser's a lot of moral leeway. After all, they are the 'one true way' and everyone else is wrong.</p>


	<p>We can see evidence of this in the history of the Church. Look at how they treated indigenous peoples and religions. In Wales, it was a crime to teach Welsh. Over 5 million women were burned at the stake, with the blessing of the church, because they were suspected to be witches. The Church even published, or at least blessed (the reports differ on that), a book "<a href="http://www.malleusmaleficarum.org/">The Malleus Maleficarum</a>", that detailed how to torture "<span style="font-style: italic;">witches</span>" into confessing their heresy. Often the "<span style="font-style: italic;">witches</span>" were just women that offended the local priest or headman. Also, how many people were tortured and killed by the Inquisition for any number of things , including not agreeing with the Inquisition on religious matters?</p>


	<p>For example, did you know that a Council of bishops declared that Jesus was divine? (Council of Nicea, 325 AD - <a href="http://www.gospelcom.net/chi/GLIMPSEF/Glimpses/glmps088.shtml">here</a> and <a href="http://reslight.addr.com/item0007.html">here</a>. Many more resources are available on the net , use <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a>). All over the place, we have Men declaring Their truth is The Only Truth and killing those that oppose them.</p>


	<p>What about the bible? Is is inspired by god or just a convenient fiction? I do not know, but this is fact , large parts of the bible that did not agree with the Church's views were tossed right out. <a href="http://www.scborromeo.org/truth/fig4.htm">Here</a> is a partial list of the books that they had. Many are still available, and the Anglican Church still uses many of them in their services. Here is a good discussion on forms of <a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/chr_hcri.htm">criticism of the bible</a>, it's tactics and the arguments used by Christians to defend it.</p>


	<p>I will never stand in the way of someone who wants to believe a certain way - I simply hold that they should extend me the same right. I also firmly believe that people and organizations should be held responsible for their actions, under the law of the land. To believe that we are 'above' or 'better' then the law of the land is inviting disaster. In my most humble opinion, the most important law is - <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">do no harm</span>.</p>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The day after yesterday I saw a pretty good movie called <a href="http://www.thedayaftertomorrow.com/">The Day After Tomorrow</a>. In it there is a lot of heroism and stuff , but what I really grokked was the science.</p>


	<p>The basic story was that the climate shifts suddenly, and a lot of scientists say 'I told you so!'</p>


	<p>Now, I do not think that these things could happen over 3 days like in the movie , but there is mounting evidence that such things could happen over several years. You seem it all comes down to something called '<a href="http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2004/05mar_arctic.htm">the Atlantic Conveyor</a>' which is a current that pumps warm water up north, and takes cold water down south.</p>


	<p>There is <a href="http://www.esd.ornl.gov/projects/qen/transit.html">historical evidence</a> that the last ice age (between 10,000 and 20,000 years ago) was sudden in onset. Sudden, meaning with in a <a href="http://www.whoi.edu/institutes/occi/currenttopics/climatechange_wef.html">decade</a>. Could you imagine the northern reaches of the United States and all of Canada being pushed under a sheet of ice in the next six years?</p>


	<p>All of this is being caused by <a href="http://calspace.ucsd.edu/virtualmuseum/climatechange1/cc1syllabus.shtml">global warming</a> , funnily enough. As the worldwide mean temperature rises, more ice melts off of the ice caps. This lowers the salt content of the Oceans, which causes the conveyors to stop functioning, which causes the temperatures to drop dramatically closer to the poles and raise closer to the equator.</p>


	<p>This is such a serious thing, that the <a href="http://ipsnews.net/interna.asp?idnews=22410">Pentagon</a> has funded <a href="http://www.fortune.com/fortune/technology/articles/0,15114,582584-3,00.html">studies</a> into it, fearing what such climatological shifts could do to world stability. As much of the food production changes from the locations that we are used to to new places (as the current breadbaskets will be under sheets of ice or deserts) the geopolitical landscape could radically change.</p>


	<p>Wars fought over rapidly vanishing farmlands, massive migrations of people away from the desert that they used to call home, it all sounds like a science fiction story.</p>


	<p>What can we do today to help? I have heard the climate called 'a big ship' in that, once it starts to move in a direction, it can be hard to change it's course. However, everyone of us can help. Stop using wasteful vehicles , switch to cleaner hybrids or bio diesel driven cars and trucks. Lower that thermostat in your house , even if you use electricity, it might be coming from coal fired plants. Walk, or ride a bike instead of driving. Recycle. The mantra of the Greens. It's not hard, it is just sad that the current marketplace makes it so expensive to do these things.</p>


	<p>The one thing that we can do is stop eating hamburgers. You think I am kidding? <a href="http://www.cgfi.org/materials/articles/2005/april_01_05.htm">Cows</a> produce a lot of green house gases!</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote> 'I am not a logician. I am an existentialist. I believe in this meaningless, beautiful chaos of existence, and I am ready to go with it wherever it leads. I don't have a goal, because existence has no goal. It simply is, flowering, blossoming, dancing - but don't ask why. Just an overflow of energy, for no reason at all. I am with existence."  Osho</blockquote>

I also identify with Discordism, and this passage neatly intertwines Buddhism, Zen and Discord. No Mind - existing at the whim of the present merges neatly with Discordism
<blockquote><center>
GP: Is Eris true?
M2: Everything is true.
GP: Even false things?
M2: Even false things are true.
GP: How can that be?
M2: I don't know man, I didn't do it.</center></blockquote>

	<p>Why are we so concerned with Why we are here? If we found out, would it really change that much? Why not just live each day the best we can, and die with peace? And, honestly, does the universe really make that much sense?</p>


	<p>Every time we dig deeper with Physics, or String Theory, we find another layer of complexity. It's like the universe is an Onion with layer after layer of tear inspiring complexity. Will we really ever get to the bottom of the rabbit hole? Do we want to?</p>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Everything is under the great paradox. To balance within the walls of the paradox is the goal. It is like a game, hence all the games afoot.
Even the Elohim [whom claim to be our creators] love the violent games. I told them, how immature to keep repeating the same game over and over...

Anyway, the paradox is a triangle. The one wall is the great life screen which we live it all out on. The side walls both go down to a single point, no fourth wall. The point or connecting of the two walls has nothing. Where does the images on the screen wall come from?

The two walls represent good and evil, anything like this applies.
We live in a triangle, no floor or ceiling, just pretend you see one. Yet we're trapped till a higher authority comes for us.
One came for me, yet I don't die yet.
Soon perhaps.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In my net reading for the last article I posted, I came across a site that I kind of liked. The person behind the site has several books out, and I plan on getting a few of them. I lifted some quotes from his site that impacted me the most, and decided to put them here for ya'll with my commentary over the next few days.</p>


<blockquote>"I have no wish to placate you with false, hollow and worthless words exhorting you to love mankind. The so-called religions have said these things to you for generations. I am here to urge you to love real men, to love your fellow beings - not mankind but the men who live and work around you. Humanity is just a word; mankind is just a label. You cannot find humanity or mankind anywhere. And so humanity is easy to love because the only thing you have to do is mouth a few platitudes." - Osho</blockquote>

	<p>I have a book called Everyday Zen. One of the passages talks about tooth-brushing. If, when you were 4 or 5 and starting to brush your teeth, you dwelled on how you would have to do this every day for the rest of your life, you might not have ever started. However, I doubt that you did. Instead, you simply did it today. Habits are easy to form if you just do the action today.</p>


	<p>Most major changes seem large, if you look at the entire thing. Sort of like painting an elephant. Over all, it is an overwhelming task. But, if you get close, and look at just the trunk, and decide to paint it, it would not take all that long. and the same with the legs, sides and back. Sooner then not, you are looking at a pink elephant.</p>


	<p>The same thing with Love. Do not aspire to love all of humanity. just aspire to love the people that you meet through out the day. The Dali Lama spoke about thinking "I Love You" you every person that you meet through out the day. He said that puts you in the correct frame of mind, and that the person can tell through your body language and expression what you are thinking. This puts them at ease and makes true communication possible.</p>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><center>So whatcha doin' tonight?<br />
Have you heard that the world's gone crazy? <br />
Young Americans listen when I say there's people puttin' us down<br />
I know they're sayin' that we've gone lazy<br />
To tell you the truth we've all seen better days<br />
Don't need no fast buck lame duck profits for fun<br />
Quick trick plans, take the money and run<br />
We need long term, slow burn, getting it done<br />
And some straight talking, hard working son of a gun.<br />
Whatcha doin' tonight, I got faith in our generation<br />
Let's stick together and futurize our attitudes<br />
I ain't lookin' to fight, but I know with determination<br />
We can challenge the schemers who cheat all the rules<br />
Come on take pride, be wise, spottin' the fools<br />
No more big shots, crackpots bending the rules<br />
A fair shot here for me and for you<br />
Knowing that we can't lose<br />
<em>Styx Rocking the Paradise</em></center></blockquote>

<p>I think that these words ring as true today as they did in 1981 when the album was released. Except, now the people puttin' us down are also blowing us up and have declared war, not on us, but on our way of life.</p>

<p>The enemy does not want to take some of our land, they want to see all of us dead. They want our way of life dead. They want to strangle Ronald McDonald in the street, and behead Jack (of Jack in the Box) in front of a video camera. They want to control what music we listen to, what we wear and how we worship.</p>

<p>Now, as a Buddhist, I am supposed to be against killing. And I am in most cases. However, I feel that defense of my family's life, of my freedom and of the freedom of my country people is a worthy cause. I salute the men and women that are on the front lines , giving up their holiday time with their family's to defend us, and to help another people realize the freedom that we all deserve.</p>

<p>As a people, we must approach the rest of the world with compassion, and a iron fist in a velvet glove. When we need to hit, it must be hard, precise and with out remorse. However, when the iron fist is not the answer, we have to start actually helping the rest of the world. We cannot continue our ways of funding extremists who happen to be fighting our enemy at the time. If there is a famine, we need to assist as the richest country in the world can. We need stop propping up governments and companies, and start dealing with the problems at home. We need to behave less like codependent parents and more like a good friend.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://davejustus.blogspot.com/2004/12/email-controversy.html">Dave Justus</a> says in re an article at <a href="http://www.forbes.com/technology/ebusiness/feeds/ap/2004/12/22/ap1725617.html">Forbes</a>:</p>


<blockquote>Yahoo! is standing by its policy of protecting the privacy of its e-mail subscribers, spokeswoman Karen Mahon said. This is an interesting dilemma. Should an email account and the electronic documents it contains be considered part of an estate, to be transferred to the heirs of a person after death or should it remain private? Typically I believe traditional letters would become the property of the heirs but one could argue, as I guess Yahoo! is doing, that email accounts do not automatically transfer.
</blockquote>
I think that in this increasingly digital age, this is going to become more of a problem. I know that if I were to die today, there are three sites that would die as well, as my brain is the only place the passwords are kept.

	<p>Passwords and accounts need to be willed. One should leave specific instructions on how to handle all of ones affairs - and now days that includes Blogs, Websites, email accounts, Pay Pal accounts, Ebay - the list goes on and on.</p>


	<p>I side with Yahoo! on this one - unless there are specific instructions in the Will of the person that gives his or her heirs the rights to access the accounts. There could be information in the email that perhaps he did not want people to read. We do not know. With out more specific instructions from the deceased, I feel that we should not impinge upon his privacy.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Why can't we have the Christmas Spirit all year?</p>


	<p>Not the one where angry housewives beat each other up to obtain the newest stuffed toy, or fustrated drivers try and kill each other while exiting the malls of America. I am talking about gathering around the family, enjoying them. Forget the presents, the Egg Nog, and Xeroxing your butt at the company party.</p>


	<p>This season is not about making some shopkeeper's books balance. It's about seeing loved ones. It's about celebrating the days starting to get longer. Of all the years and all the Holiday seasons that I have lived through - here is a list of the best memories that I have:</p>


	<p>Making turkey stuffing with my Dad</p>


	<p>Visiting my Aunt in LA - Several times</p>


	<p>Seeing my Granny in Oregon</p>


	<p>Playing Jenga at another Aunts house</p>


	<p>When I got my Porche from Santa.</p>


	<p>Just kidding about the last one.</p>


	<p>We should try and focus on the good times, good freinds and family. The Corps have pushed and advertised us and coaxed us into thinking that the season is about how much you can buy, how much more useless crap you can stuff into you life. If you are not spending a ton of money on those that you love, then you must really not love them, right?</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>First off, we need to be all reading from the same page, so here are some definitions:<br /><br />Free software is <a href=http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html>defined</a> as:<br /><br /><i>* The freedom to run the program, for any purpose (freedom 0). <br /><br />* The freedom to study how the program works, and adapt it to your needs (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this. <br /><br />* The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor (freedom 2). <br /><br />* The freedom to improve the program, and release your improvements to the public, so that the whole community benefits (freedom 3). Access to the source code is a precondition for this. </i><br /><br />Open Source Software is <a href=http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php>defined</a> as:<br /><br /><i>* The license shall not restrict any party from selling or giving away the software as a component of an aggregate software distribution containing programs from several different sources. The license shall not require a royalty or other fee for such sale.<br />The program must include source code, and must allow distribution in source code as well as compiled form.<br /><br />* The license must allow modifications and derived works, and must allow them to be distributed under the same terms as the license of the original software.<br /><br />* The license may restrict source-code from being distributed in modified form only if the license allows the distribution of "patch files" with the source code for the purpose of modifying the program at build time.<br /><br />* The license must not discriminate against any person or group of persons.<br /><br />* The license must not restrict anyone from making use of the program in a specific field of endeavor. For example, it may not restrict the program from being used in a business, or from being used for genetic research.<br /><br />* The rights attached to the program must apply to all to whom the program is redistributed without the need for execution of an additional license by those parties.<br /><br />* The rights attached to the program must not depend on the program's being part of a particular software distribution. <br /><br />* The license must not place restrictions on other software that is distributed along with the licensed software. For example, the license must not insist that all other programs distributed on the same medium must be open-source software.<br /><br />* No provision of the license may be predicated on any individual technology or style of interface.</i><br /><br />Now that we have the definitions out of the way, we can continue on and discuss the rationale behind these movements, and what they bring to the table in our real world. The two terms seem very similar, in fact the only difference is that you can sell open source software, and free software is, well, free.<br /><br /><span class="caps">OSS</span> (Open Source Software) and <span class="caps">FOSS</span> (Free/Open Source Software) are on a track to merge. The <span class="caps">FOSS</span> movement was started long before the <span class="caps">OSS</span> movement, and the <span class="caps">OSS</span> language was brought about to entice more corporate involvement. It was thought that in some circles 'free' equated to 'bad' , you get what you pay for.<br /><br /><a href=http://mako.yukidoke.org/copyrighteous/freesoftware/20041231-00.html>Mako</a> said:<br /><br />'<i>While the ideology of open source seems to be waning in popularity, the term "open source" is growing in strength. More importantly, the software itself is bigger than ever and growing quickly. In Spain, regional governments are embracing "open source" and software libre. In Munich, in Brazil, and in non-profit organizations and schools around the globe, "open source" is a familiar phrase.</i>â€<br /><br />Anyways, what does this all mean, you ask?<br /><br />I am a proponent of <span class="caps">OSS</span>/FOSS (to be called Free Software from now on), and I wanted to take a moment to explain why.<br /><br />If you recall (or read my archives) in one of the first posts, I talked about <a href=http://www.ubuntulinux.org/>Ubuntu Linux as my distribution of choice, because I believed in what they were doing and the language that they used.<br /><br />For me, Free Software is about empowerment. It empowers common people, what ever their lot in life, to have the most powerful tools at their hands. With <a href=http://www.openoffice.org/>Open Office, anyone can create professional looking documents, spreadsheets and presentions, and not have to pay hundreds of dollars for the right. People can have a safe computing experience, practically immune to the spate of worms, viruses, and other garbage that threatens Internet users today. They can be assured of their right to privacy, knowing full well that their Operating System is not sending reports about what software they have installed, nor recording how many times the hardware in their machine is changed. It takes the power away from an elite few, and gives it back to the masses. <br /><br />But software is expensive to develop, you proclaim! Who is going to pay the salary of all of these people?<br /><br />Some do it for the love of the software, on their weekends. Some are hired by major corporations who service the software, or sell hardware to go along with the software, to insure that their needs are met. <a href=http://www-136.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/index.html><span class="caps">IBM</span></a>, <a href=http://developer.novell.com/ndk/qstart/opensource.htm>Novell</a> and <a href=http://developer.apple.com/darwin/>Apple are companies that embody this new economy. <span class="caps">IBM</span> and Novell have teams of developers who work on <span class="caps">OSS</span>/FOSS projects, to insure that their needs are met with the next release. Novell has teams of people working on the Gnome Desktop, <span class="caps">KDE</span> Desktop, Linux Kernel, Mono and many others. <span class="caps">IBM</span> works on many of the same projects, and funds many others. Apple (with the advent of their rocking <span class="caps">OS X</span>) has switched to <span class="caps">BSD</span> internals and gives back much of the work that they do.<br /><br />Now, these are simply companies, with their bottom line to watch out for, so not all have done a fantastic job over the years. It's been fits and starts for a while, but the future is bright indeed.<br /><br />From the <a href=http://www.ubuntulinux.org>Ubuntu Linux</a> Homepage:<br /><br /><i>* Ubuntu will always be free of charge, and there is no extra fee for the "enterprise edition", we make our very best work available to everyone on the same Free terms. <br /><br />* Ubuntu includes the very best in translations and accessibility infrastructure that the Free Software community has to offer, to make Ubuntu usable by as many people as possible. <br /><br />* Ubuntu is released regularly and predictably; a new release is made every six months. You can use the current stable release or the current development release. Each release is supported for at least 18 months. <br /><br />* Ubuntu is entirely committed to the principles of open source software development; we encourage people to use open source software, improve it and pass it on.</i><br /><br />-Tsyko</p>]]></content:encoded>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, I <a href=http://tsykoduk.blogspot.com/2005/01/open-source-software.html>ranted at length</a> about the meaning of <span class="caps">FOSS</span> and <span class="caps">OSS</span>. I think just about everything has been said about <span class="caps">OSS</span> development that can be. We all know that it is a better development model because all of the code is open for world wide peer review. We also know that if you have the desire, you can review the code yourself and assure yourself that it is indeed secure. While this is not an option for most home users, large enterprises can use this option to assure their security and modify the code to do what they need.<br /><br />All of that is well and good. However, for me this whole Free Software movement is more about compassion. While this seems to be a strange link - think of this. If I live in a third world country, and I start a small business, am I going to be able to afford paying the fees to stand up a Windows based Email Server, Web Server, Firewall Server, and put computers with Office and Windows (as well as the all-pervasive virus scanners, spy ware blockers, workstation firewalls, ad naseum) on all of my employees desks? How am I to secure and lock these machines down so that I am sure that my employees are not just playing solitaire and browsing the web? Can I compete with the large company that buys computers by the pallet from Dell?<br /><br />I propose that Free Software would be a better option. There are industrial strength firewalls, servers, email systems and more. Just about every program that you use has been recreated. I personally use <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">The Gimp</a> for my photo editing, Open Office for my word processing and spreadsheet needs. I use Ubuntu Linux at home as my primary Operating System. I do have a dual boot on one of my machines into Windows XP, but weeks can go by with out my booting into it.<br /><br />Now, just because you use Windows does not mean that you have to let the wonders of Free Software. Open Office, The Gimp and many other applications have been ported back to windows.<br /><br />Heh. Ported 'back' to Windows.<br /><br />Anyways, why would I want to use an office package that costs $600 and is upgraded every few years, when I can download and use Open Office for free? Open office reads and writes Microsoft Office 2000 files pretty much seamlessly , so sharing with my work computer is not a problem.<br /><br />In fact, I often throw files from work on my thumb drive, take it home, plug in into my Linux Box and work on them. I take them back to work, and open them in Microsoft Office. No headaches, no muss.<br /><br />My firewall at home is running on a Pentium 90 with 64 megs of <span class="caps">RAM</span> and a two gig Hard Drive. I swapped it out with a Netgear router/firewall and noticed no difference in speed or latency. So, now I have the Netgear on the 'outside' facing the Internet, and serving wireless to my laptop. Inside of that is my 'ol firewall, running IP Tables and Linux. Inside of that are my desktops and my server. <span class="caps">A VPN</span> punches through the firewall to give my laptop access to my files and printers.<br /><br />All of this cost me 1 Netgear wireless AP and Router. No software costs, and it's all legal. I think that's the best thing about this. I am honoring the licenses of all of the software that I run. I really dislike people that steal others property. When you pirate software, you are stealing. When you use Free Software, you are not stealing, since it is free to use, and give to others.<br /><br />So, obey the license restrictions of the software that you use. If you want to try Open Source, check out this <a href="http://theopencd.sunsite.dk/">CD</a>. It has a bunch of open source software for windows that you can use.<br /><br />Play Nice!<br /><br /><br /><br />-Tsyko</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://emilyscraziness.blogspot.com/2005/01/back-to-governor-thing.html">emily</a> has this to say<br /><br />"<i>...Personally, I think that the fact that the results have been changed and victory has been declared over 120-something votes (after people criticizing a so-called victory of 420 votes) is a little out-of-whack. If you still care (and are a voter for WA), you can find the petition for a re-vote <a href=http://www.revotewa.com/petition.htm>here</a>. I don't have time at the moment for a longer post than this. Later!</i>"<br /><br />Can't agree more. Click on through, nothing to see here citizen.<br /><br />-Tsyko<br /></p>]]></content:encoded>

Yes, the means in which we got here are disappointing, but whats done is done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gregoire isn't the end of the world, and we would be better served by just moving on, and using that moral highground to try and achieve a victory with enough margins so it can't be questioned next time.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I voted for Rossi, and it was not an uninformed vote.  As Attorney General of WA, Gregoire published multiple memos (and related work) during her tenure used for the edification of LE officers statewide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gregoire is so far to the left on matters of criminal justice I always had a hard time believing she was actually AG.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, I have become somewhat apathetic towards politics and our political process.  I feel that in the grand scheme of the universe it matters not one whit who is voted into what office.  Life will go on, and those of us down here in &quot;Honest-day's-work-for-an-honest-day's-pay&quot; Land will continue to shuffle along at our own pace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's up to -&gt;us&lt;- to be happy.

I don't really care which one wins, I just want to make sure that it is fair and above board. I cannot say that about the current election. There were too many questions raised by too many people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps we need to bring UN election monitors in if we do the second try... :)]]></wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>It is reasonable to doubt. Doubt arises when there is rational thinking. Come you Kalamas, do not go by reports, by dogmatism, by traditions, by holy scripture, by rational argument, by logical reasoning, by inference from observation, by views based on mystical experience, by probability, or by faith in a teacher. When you know for yourself that, "these experiences are not good, these experiences are faulty, these experiences are deplored by intelligent people; these experiences, when undertaken and carried out, lead to harm and to suffering", then you should abandon them.

	<p>When you know for yourselves that, "these experiences are good; these experiences are not faulty, these experiences are praised by the wise; these experiences, when undertaken and carried out, lead to welfare and happiness"... then you should enter and remain in them.</p>

Initial data taken by the robot's Mini-Thermal Emission Spectrometer (Mini-TES) is suggestive that the odd-looking "rock" is made of metal.</i><br /><br />It's just amazing that this probe is still doing good science like this. A fantasic investment for the world made by the <span class="caps">USA</span>.<br /><br />It's incredible - in the same week we land a probe on Titan - one of the more likely objects to have an 'interesting' surface, and a really old probe finds a 'strange' thing just lying about on Mars.<br /><br />There should be some really intresting news coming out of <span class="caps">NASA</span> over the next few months.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<center><a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/cassini/multimedia/huygens-2.html"><span class="caps">NASA</span> - Huygens at Titan</a>:<br /></center><br /><center><img src=http://www.nasa.gov/images/content/105736main_Crop448-H2.jpg/></center><br /><br /><i>This is one of the first raw images returned by the European Space Agency's Huygens probe during its successful descent to Titan. It was taken from an altitude of 16.2 kilometers (about 10 miles) with a resolution of approximately 40 meters (about 131 feet) per pixel. It apparently shows short, stubby drainage channels leading to a shoreline.</i><br /><br />Wow. They said <i>shoreline</i>. There are more great pictures at the <a href=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/cassini/main/index.html><span class="caps">NASA</span></a> site and the <a href=http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/Cassini-Huygens/index.html><span class="caps">ESA</span></a> site.<br /><br />The theory that Titan has had liquid seas has always really intrigued me. I guess that liquid of some sort seems like a prequsite for life to spring forth. So, we really have 3 likely objects for life in the solar system. Titan, Europa and Earth. We know that there is life on earth, but the jury is still out on if it's sustainable or not. Europa, with the possiblity of liquid water under it's icey exterior, would be a strange place indeed for life to spring up. Titan, enshrouded in a cloudy mantle has always been a question mark.<br /><br />Huygens is starting to peirce that mantle. Since this is a joint operation of <span class="caps">NASA</span>, European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency we hope that any really stunning findings will not be quashed.<br /><br />]]></content:encoded>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was driving around the blog-o-sphere last nite, and I came across a mention of <a href=http://www.google.com/search?q=back+flab&#38;start=0&#38;start=0&#38;ie=utf-8&#38;oe=utf-8&#38;client=firefox&#38;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:unofficial>Back Flab</a> at <a href=http://poorrolemodel.blogspot.com/2005/01/beauty-tips-vs-ugly-tips.htm>PoorRoleModel</a>. Now this got me thinking. And jiggling. <br /><br />Do I have back flab? <br /><br />How can I tell? I do not often actually <b>look</b> at my back. So, sitting in the <a href=http://www.ai.mit.edu/people/paulfitz/spanish/index.html>Comfy Chair</a> I started to jiggle my back. To see if it would, infact, jiggle.<br /><br />Sadly, no jiggling.<br /><br />Well, no jiggling on my back.<br /><br />I guess I will have to work harder if I want to get some back flab of my own. Or perhaps I could just go out and buy some?<br /><br />I think that I should research companys that sell back flab. When this gets out, there is going to be a run on this stuff, and their stock could do better then a <a href=http://www.zoology.ubc.ca/~bwilson/herring.html>dry herring</a> at a <a href=http://www.everythingferret.com/gastrointestinal_disorders_in_ferrets.htm>ferret eating</a> contest.<br /><br /><br /><br /></p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am currently reading '<a href=http://www.randomhouse.com/crown/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=1400080797>The Quantum and the Lotus</a>' , a very good book. It talks about the convergence between modern scientific theory and Buddhist philosophy.<br /><br />One of the passages talks about how reality is an illusion, and how we collectivity determine what reality is. Now this has interesting ramifications. For example, if you were to live in a culture where everyone believed in pixies, then perhaps they would actually exist, as far as that culture extended.<br /><br />How can that be?<br /><br />I will take a example that they used in the book, and expand on it a bit.<br /><br />Say, that you are a person living on an island in a river. To one side, there is a farmhouse, and to the other side there is a copse of trees. There is a rainbow above, that stretches from the farmhouse to the copse of trees.<br /><br />From your perspective, being confined to that island , would it not be easy to believe that the rainbow comes from the farmhouse and stretches across the sky, and your entire universe, to the copse of trees? What sort of belief structure would you come up with? Would you venerate the farmhouse and trees? What would you feel about the little figures that you could see living in the farmhouse?<br /><br /><center><i>Meditate on what life and your beliefs would be like living on that island.</i></center><br /><br />Now, say, you were plucked off the island, and placed into the farmhouse's front yard. Would the experience live up to the beliefs? Where would the rainbow be , that you had seen coming from the farmhouse? What would that do to your world view and beliefs?<br /><br />Reality really depends on the observer. A cat, dog, insect and human have radically different views of what reality is. Is any of their views less probable, or less real then ours? How about the world view of a bat, that only sees thought reflected sound?<br /><br />I propose that what we call reality is in fact a convenient illusion, created in part by our minds to deal with the world around us, and in part created by the collective beliefs of all of us to provide a common frame of reference to enable communication. <br /><br />Reality is <b>taught</b> to us by our community and our parents.<br /><br /><br />-Tsyko<br /></p>]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The more that I delve into Buddhism, the more that I think Lucas got some of his ideas for the Jedi from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was talking to a co-worker on a drive yesterday, and I  brough up a theory that I have had for a long time: Reality has inerta. This inerta is created by the belief/perception of other people and the ingrained belief that you yourself carry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reality is determined by your perception, your belief and the interta of reality. So, in past times when people belived that supernatural events happened regularly, there was less inerta working against such acts it would have been 'easier' to preform them.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I saw that book and I was considering picking it up. I like science. I like Buddhism. Seemed like a winning combination to me. I always find myself thinking about unanswerable questions (i.e., what is mind, what is reality, is there a life essence beyond the body, why do I constantly waste my time).

In thinking about reality and perception I guess I feel that there are some things which we may or may not know (reality) and then there is our best determination (perception) of reality based on our limited ability to see the &quot;truth.&quot; Perception is the tip of the iceberg while reality is everything that you can and cannot see. I know this is a bad analogy but it makes me think about statistics and type I and type II errors. I'm going to end up talking myself into a oneway street, so I'll leave it at that.

No doubt Lucus incorporated samurai code into Jedi behavior.]]></wp:comment_content>

&lt;i&gt; Perception is the tip of the iceberg while reality is everything that you can and cannot see.&lt;/i&gt;

I agree. Like the four blind men and the elephant. We do not see reality, we could not comprehend it's fullness.]]></wp:comment_content>

These are dukkha (explained above), anicca (impermanence), and anattÃ¡ (insubstantiality, "no-soul"). The attributes of God are not consistent with these universal marks of existence. Thus God must be free from dukkha; he must be eternal (and hence not subject to anicca); finally he must have a distinct unchanging identity (and therefore lack the characteristic of anattÃ¡)."</i></center><br /><br />From <a href="http://www.buddhistinformation.com/buddhist_attitude_to_god.htm">The Buddhist Attitude to God</a><br /><br />If God exists, and he/she/it is omnibenevolent as the teachings of the christian church have us belive, then what about evil?

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[This is of course a question that has long puzzled theologists.  To me, it doesn't seem all that difficult in that the answer is that what we percieve as 'evil' or 'bad' is evil only from our current, mortal perspective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an example:  I know that you are a GM for role playing games.  In this activity, you are the 'God' of the world you create.  I am sure that even though you are probably a 'Good' GM, you visit calamities and misfortune on the poor people of your created world.  Even though you may wipe out entire planets with a whim, this is a 'Good' thing because it makes the world interesting and enjoyable for the players of your game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you think about yourself as God, the players as immortal, eternal souls, and the characters as the mortal bodies those souls temporalily live in you should be able to easily see how what appears as 'evil' to the characters is in fact good for the players.  Role-playing in a world without conflict, where nothing bad ever could or would happen would not be a very worthwhile experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I don't know if we are here simply for the 'fun' of it or if there is more to it than that (I strongly suspect the latter) but I can certainly see at even that level how 'Good' and 'Evil' can be quite different depending on one's perspective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course having 'evil' things happen to you and doing evil are two different things and may have entirely different consequences from an eternal perspective.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I wonder if being a polytheist is why I rarely find myself pondering things of this nature. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't really believe in &quot;evil,&quot; and I certainly don't believe in &quot;The Devil&quot; (though I do believe that the a Christian god exists.) I just never find myself wondering why the gods allow or visit &quot;evil&quot; upon mortals. I'm not entirely sure why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though I suspect that also believing in a form of predestination and reincarnation probably has something to do with that as well.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[There are other issues with an omni-whatever deity as well. The Problem of Evil is just one that sticks hardest for me. If God were no Omni then, these logical problems keep coming up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even in a fictional game world - no one is Omni. As the game progresses, things happen that the GM (god?) did not plan for. There is also randomness. Diffrent story completly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Christian God is said to be All-Knowing, and All-Powerful&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If He knows everything, then he already knows the outcome of every event ever to happen and that will happen. If he is All-Powerful, then He has the ability to change outcomes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With His All-Knowing, he would already know the outcome of His changes, making picking the path that would lead to all people being happy and content trivial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, yet, he does not. There is senseless killing, and more importantly, senseless suffering happening each and every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If He has the knowledge and the power, why does He not fix it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I posit that he does not have the knowledge and power to fix it. I do not feel that He is as cruel as having that knowledge and power and not using it would make him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, off my soapbox ;)]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[If making all people happy and contented is a good thing, then you would be correct in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I fall back on the idea that being given happiness and contentment is not in fact good for us or in fact desirable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An interesting (and entertaining) exploration of this idea can be found in Orson Scott Card's The Worthing Saga.  If you haven't read it, I highly recommend it.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I think that happyiness is the ultimate goal. Each of us must be responsible for our own happiness. We also must do what we can to spread happiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;I saw young children who have lost their hands. I asked one how, and he said by sword, by the Janjaweed [militia]&quot; - from &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.blogger.com/r?http%3A%2F%2Fdavejustus.blogspot.com%2F2005%2F01%2Fdarfur-genocide.html%23comments&quot;&gt;Justus For All&lt;/A&gt;If a person, with the means and ability to stop this kind of action, were to stand by and allow it to happen, would that not be condoning via non-action, or at the very least neglect?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If a person could have simply given a warning about the Tsunami, and saved countless thousands of lives, and chose not to - how would that person be judged in world opinion if that fact came out?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yet people accept an omnipotent God standing by and not doing anything. And they say He Loves Us most of all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The book of Job is an excellent example of this. God allowed a follower of his to loose his family, livelihood, everything. On a &lt;B&gt;bet&lt;/B&gt;. If a person were to do half of what happened to Job to someone and the police were to find out, they would be in some pretty serious trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that was just &quot;testing his faith&quot;. Cannot God see inside of us, what we truly are and believe? Why then must he &quot;test our faith&quot; with trials and tribulations?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot believe that God is so small, callous and immature as this. This is why the only thing that I can believe is, if he does exist, that he is not omnipotent, omnipresent and omniscient. That he is bound by the same laws of the universe that we are. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps he is on a different plane of existence, perhaps he has powers that are incredible, but he cannot know everything that is going to happen, and cannot have the power to effect the entire universe at the snap of a finger.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Sure, and a large purple chicken laid the Earth, and we have lived in chaos ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem with deity discussions is it always assumes the existence of some mystical being, or beings, that are on some separate plane of reality and playing with man-kind on Earth like some twisted cosmic role-playing game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no God, no Goddess, no large purple chicken that decides the fate of mankind.  It is a natural order of things that plays by the rules that have evolved along with the universe in which we live.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just because we cannot understand how the universe works does not mean some super-being must have created it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know many folks enjoy the serenity of believing that there surely must be something more to life then just that we live and die.  There must be some heavenly place where we will all go and have BBQ's with our ancestor's when we cease to exist here on our little patch of dirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The truth is, and always will be, we're here on Earth alone without a nasty super-being with a 'tude we can't figure out, to brown-nose for the purpose of gaining entrance to the pearly gates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, this is just my opinion...I could be wrong.  :)]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I think most of us have, for various reasons, let someone we love suffer when we could intervene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The simplist example being disciplining a child because they are doing something dangerous or wrong.  Other examples would be letting someone try something and fail because we knew it was needed for growth even though it would cause pain.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If one accepts the Christian postulate of an immortal soul and an eternal reward than Earthly suffering and even to an extent earthly happiness matter very little.  The fact that someone is killed in a Tsunami may seem like a tradgedy to us, but not to God.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find this viewpoint to at least be internally consistant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to Mystic Knights comments, I have always found atheism to be a very foolish belief system.  Simply put, there is no margin in it.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are right, you get nothing&lt;br /&gt;If you are wrong, you presumably get Hell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If a believer is right, they get Heaven&lt;br /&gt;If a believer is wrong, they get nothing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:)]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[heh heh heh&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to think of myself rather as one of the few on this planet that has ultimately evolved beyond the need for scary stories of the underworld to ensure I do the right thing for my fellow beings on this planet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn't following a religion merely because you are afraid what might happen if you don't seem to be the more foolish approach?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Throughout my life I have chose my course of action based on my studies of the world, its history, its science, and yes, even theology.  What I have discovered is the only path for me.  In fact, my website drones on and on why I feel as I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have moved beyond being frightened what God will do to me if I don't believe in him.  You see, viewing all religion for what it truly is, man-made, removes all of that excess baggage from my psyche and allows me to move on to bigger and better things, like trying to figure out Linux!  :)]]></wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<center><i>"Microsoft has confirmed that they will no longer issue security updates for Windows 2000. In addition, standard support for Windows 2000 is currently scheduled to end in June."</i></center> <br /><br />- From <a href=http://www.osnews.com/comment.php?news_id=9532>OS News</a><br /><br />Wow. Microsoft must be hard up for cash if they are threatining half of their installed base to upgrade or loose support. They have also said that there will be no more browser upgrades until Longhorn - slated to release in '06 or '07 - well past the target date of '04. <br /><br />Win2k to XP is not a small upgrade. Especially <span class="caps">XP SP2</span> - that breaks lots of older applications.<br /><br />Now, more then ever, it is time to look into jumping off the upgrade rollercoaster and switch to a stable OS that has had security in mind for a lot longer then Windows and Microsoft ever had. One where the developers understand that security and useablity can coexist. Check out <a href=http://www.apple.com>Macs</a>, <a href=http://www.debian.org>Some</a> <a href=http://www.ubuntulinux.org>Linux</a> <a href=http://www.novell.com/linux/suse/index.html>Distro</a> or <a href=http://www.freebsd.org/><span class="caps">BSD</span>.<br /><br />]]></content:encoded>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><a href=http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=meme>meme</a> n. A unit of cultural information, such as a cultural practice or idea, that is transmitted verbally or by repeated action from one mind to another</blockquote><br /><br /><blockquote>Richard Dawkins's term for an idea considered as a replicator, especially with the connotation that memes parasitise people into propagating them much as viruses do.<br /><br />Memes can be considered the unit of cultural evolution. Ideas can evolve in a way analogous to biological evolution. Some ideas survive better than others; ideas can mutate through, for example, misunderstandings; and two ideas can recombine to produce a new idea involving elements of each parent idea.

	<p>The term is used especially in the phrase "meme complex" denoting a group of mutually supporting memes that form an organized belief system, such as a religion. However, "meme" is often misused to mean "meme complex".</p>


	<p>Use of the term connotes acceptance of the idea that in humans (and presumably other tool- and language-using sophonts) cultural evolution by selection of adaptive ideas has become more important than biological evolution by selection of hereditary traits. Hackers find this idea congenial for tolerably obvious reasons.</blockquote></p>


	<p>Memes in general are a very interesting concept. Ideas can be like mental 'viruses'. They want to survive, and they can (and do) spread.<br /><br /><blockquote>The term is used especially in the phrase "meme complex" denoting a group of mutually supporting memes that form an organized belief system, such as a religion.</blockquote></p>


	<p>A set of interrelated memes can make up a 'Meme Complex'. These groups of ideas are interrelated and co-supporting. They strengthen and reinforce each other - making the group stronger then the whole. A religion is an example of a Meme Complex. Many of the ideas central to religion are intersupporting. For example the Christian belief that a life time of good works, and belief in the Christian Religion (Meme Complex) will garner great rewards after death.</p>


	<p>This sort of interrelationship with in a Meme Complex makes the entire thing stronger, and that much more survivable in the 'wild'. In the world of Memes, it is survival of the fittest. Early Memes were probably very simple (Sun God Hot). Over time, the stronger ones survived, combined and slowly merged into more and more complex structures.</p>


	<p>This whole system is very like biological evolution. Not the our uncles were monkeys theories, but rather the 'Real' Theory of Evolution - that things change over time when exposed to environmental pressure. Not that some of my monkeys are not uncles...</p>


	<p>One of the methods that biological things evolve is through mutation. Not X-Men style mutation, but rather small changes over time. The changes that allow for better survival (and ultimately reproduction) will 'stick' and the ones that make it harder to survive will tend to be weeded out.</p>


	<p>Anyways - so we have ideas or concepts that are able to propagate, change in response to environmental pressures, and grow stronger by merging with other ideas, or simple mutation through errors in transmission (remember the telephone game from Kindergarten?).</p>


So..
<blockquote><a href=http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=toxic>toxÂ·ic</a> adj. <i>1. Of,  relating to, or caused by a toxin or other poison. 2. Capable of causing injury or death, especially by chemical means; poisonous.</i></blockquote>

	<p>Some Memes or Meme Complexes might become Toxic. They might damage the host in order to propagate more efficiently, or have some aim that is not for the best of the host or host's group. I believe that Toxic Memes are one of the more pressing issues that we, as a culture and race, face at this time. These diseases of the psyche must be investigated, and some form of inoculation or treatment be found.</p>


	<p>A few of the Toxic Memes that come to mind are things like Fanaticism of any sort - be it Christian, Muslim, or Ice Cream Loving. Several of the political belief systems fall into this category as well. Communism and Fascism come to mind.</p>


	<p>We need to find, create, sow, water and release into the wild Memes and Meme Complexes that are strong, positive, and very contagious. We need to debunk Toxic Memes, to show where they are not healthy for the carriers, and supplant them with the Meme of Love.</p>


	<p>-Tsyko</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>Mike Sarakinsky, University of South Africa:<br /><br />"I have never ordered red tape, but have been tied up by it here at the university. About 12 years ago, I needed 20 sheets of blank white A4 paper for an article I was typing. The only place to get 20 such sheets was the photocopy room. I duly requested the 20 sheets of blank paper from a photocopy assistant. He said he could not give me the sheets, but if I filled in the requisition form, he could give me 20 copies of a blank sheet of paper. Astonished, I filled in the form. Then he proceeded to actually make 20 copies of a blank sheet on the photocopier. He explained that at the end of the day, his supervisor counted the sheets of paper, read the counter on the copier machine, checked that these corresponded with the requisition forms and compared the information with the previous day's numbers. If there was any discrepancy, the fellow had to pay the difference."</i><br /><br />From this <a href=http://education.guardian.co.uk/egweekly/story/0,,1402413,00.html>article</a> posted about <a href=http://improbable.typepad.com/improbable_research_whats/2005/02/guardian_column.html>here</a>.<br /><br />Sounds like some places that I have worked..<br /></p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the hardest things that I face on a day-to-day basis is how to feel compassion for certain people. It is quite hard sometimes, to still feel compassion in the face of aggression or general nastiness. Being far from Buddhahood, I am often not with out fault in this matter. <br /><br />Over the years, I have grown quite a bit. When I was in JR. High school, I would often lash out with anger and violence. I was often sent to the office, or to detention for various nasty angry things that I did. I am not proud of that time in my life - however it was what made me today. I have grown past that in most cases now, and it takes great effort to move me to anger.<br /><br />But whose effort? Some times it is my effort - some times a mixture of others and mine. But never is it just some one else's fault. <i>It takes two to tango</i>, trite and overused - but trite and overused for a reason. It really does take two people to engage in nastiness.<br /><br />Compassion can de-escalate a situation. If you can respond with compassion at all times, the angry ones have a hard time responding with anger. Note that I did not say could not. There are people that have so much pain in side that they cannot help but to lash out. I know people like this, and they can be very hard to deal with.<br /><br />"...<i>Buddhist ethical principles are very noble and in an ideal world their practice would lead to peace and harmony but, unfortunately, as the Buddha has taught, people are motivated by greed hatred and delusion - even Buddhists. </i>"<br /><br />From <a href=http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/budethics.htm>Buddhanet</a><br /><br />-Tsyko<br /></p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a stunning study, <a href=http://offtheshelf.nowis.com/index.cfm?ID=5>Off the Shelf</a> muses about the diffrences between stealing a season of <a href="http://abc.go.com/primetime/alias/">Alias</a> online vs offline. If you were to fire up <a href="http://bittorrent.com/">Bittorrent</a> and download it, you could be liable for up to $3,400,000, 1 year jail time, lawyer fees and Court Costs. So, if you were to slip on that ol' trench coat and saunter down to <a href="http://www.gohastings.com/catalog/">Hastings</a> and slip out with a copy of that, you could be liable for $100,000 and 1 year in jail.<br /><br />Just makes me wonder.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://mako.yukidoke.org/copyrighteous/">Mako says</a>:<br /><br /><i><blockquote>Many people are worried about the nasty privacy implications <del>- realized and potential -</del> of supermarket and chain store "loyalty" cards. As <span class="caps">RFID</span> chips are introduced, things get even more scary.<br /><br />In an attempt to attack supermarkets' data-mining operation and to gain a new shopping identity in the process, many people have taken to swapping cards with each other. Over the last few years, I've been among these people.<br /><br />A couple years ago, a few friends and I came up with the idea of creating a sort of online loyalty card swap-meet where people could come and exchange their supermarket or chain-store loyalty cards with total strangers from the privacy of their own homes. Some other people have arranged to swap numbers for particular stores but our idea was to swap the actual cards from any store that uses a card. We actually built most of it but got hung up at the last minute on a couple of details and with writing some of the explanatory text.<br /><br />Last night, I made the final push and finished the code and set everything up and seeded the database with the lists of as many supermarkets that I know use loyalty cards as listed on <span class="caps">CASPIAN</span>'s supermarket list.<br /><br />If you've got an extra card (and maybe if you don't), go ahead and sign up to swap! This is one of those things that works better when more people do it so tell your friends and spread the word.<br /><br />Information and the card-swapping apparatus is all online at: <a href=http://cardexchange.org>cardexchange.org</a></blockquote></i><br /><br />Sounds like a very cool idea to me. I very well might be trying this new service out. One of the cool things that I have noticed, is the checkers at one of my local chain stores keep their cards with them, and use them if the customer does not have a card. Gets us the savings, and saves the planet from Big Brother.<br /><br />- Tsyko</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.macworld.co.uk/news/index.cfm?RSS&amp;NewsID=10827">Macworld UK - PC makers want to license Mac OS</a><br /><br /><blockquote><i>"Apple has to fight off three of the biggest PC companies, sick of the security bugs that plague Windows, wanting to license the Mac operating system.<br /><br />The revelation came in a <a href="http://www.fortune.com/fortune/technology/articles/0,15114,1025093,00.html">Fortune </a> magazine interview with Apple <span class="caps">CEO</span> Steve Jobs, described by <a href="http://macdailynews.com/index.php/weblog/comments/4950/">MacDailyNews</a> as 'an embarrassment of riches' because it is so full of information."</i></blockquote><br /><br />Sounds like a really good idea to me. There would be some technical issues at first, however I think that with a <a href=http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/hcl/default.mspx>Hardware Compablity List</a> (like so many other vendors have published) it would be a good thing.<br /><br />Apple hardware would still be superior - the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerPC>PowerPC</a> chips are better then Intel/AMD's, and Apple has the market cornered on Cool.<br /><br />-Tsyko</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>And not really caring. Most of the pre-digested pabulum that they play is just crap. I really dislike where modern Pop music has gone. Record execs in silver towers make choices based on what will make <b>them</b> the most money, rather then what is good music.<br /><br />Television it's self is mostly crap now days. Shela likes to watch a lot of TV. Well, a lot in my mind. When we met I did have a TV. But it was only hooked up to my Playstation and <span class="caps">DVD</span> player. Not even bunny ears. I had no need for TV. I used the heck out of <a href=http://www.netflix.com>Netflix</a>. I had to increase my subscription to 8 movies at home because I would blow through 4 or 5 movies in a weekend, and I liked to have one or two for the week.<br /><br />I also did a lot of computing - errr - playing on the computers at home then as well. Now I am relegated to the laptop on a lazy boy, trying to ignore the TV. <br /><br />Oh - god - Ricky Martin. I think that I am going to be sick. In Spanish. :)<br /><br />This Ricky Martin/J-Lo thing reminds me of a movie - Four Rooms. Especially the part with Antonio Banderas. Cool stuff.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a> writes:<br /><br /><blockquote>Criminals posing as legitimate businesses have accessed critical personal data stored by ChoicePoint Inc., a firm that maintains databases of background information on virtually every U.S. citizen. The incident involves a wide swath of consumer data, including names, addresses, Social Security numbers, credit reports and other information. ChoicePoint notified between 30,000 and 35,000 consumers in California that their personal data may have been accessed by 'unauthorized third parties.' No obvious notice appears to be on their website.</blockquote><br /><br />Wow. Scary. Read <a href="http://www.epic.org/privacy/choicepoint/">this</a> for some background about who uses Choicepoint and what kind of services and data they provide.<br /><br />One would have hoped that a company that deals with such sensitive data would have stronger safeguards in place. Hopefully this breach is a wake up call for them and the rest out there...<br /><br />-Tsyko</p>]]></content:encoded>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So - there are several logical problems with the concept of God. I would like to explore a few of them right now.<br /><br />Let's assume that God is omni-whatever.<br /><br />Where does he live?<br /><br />Time is woven into the fabric of our universe. As space stretches and warps, time is stretched and warped the same.  Time and space are basically the same thing. This is not a theory - it has been experimentally proven several times since the big E proposed it.<br /><br />Time is also subjective, rather then objective. We determine time's flow in our brain and nervous system. It is not some universal constant, rather a construct of our psychology and physiology.  You can see that yourselves. When you are bored, the hours seem to drag on. When you are focused and busy, time seems to just fly by.<br /><br />I think that we can also all agree that every event has a cause. Things do not 'just happen' on their own. If a tree falls in a forest, it is because something caused it to fall. Gravity, breakdown at the cellular level causing structural failure, wind - some thing caused it to fall. There can be no event with out some cause.<br /><br />All this said, where does God live? In our universe, or some place external?<br /><br />Let's look at each option (and there are only two - here or there)<br /><br />Here - God lives in our universe. There are a few complications that this raises.<br /><br />If He lives here, then he would be bound by the rules in effect here. He would be bound by Time, and therefore would not know everything. He could not know every cause and effect, because some effects have not happened, and the effects that they cause are not know.<br /><br />Also - if he lives here, how did he create the universe that he is part of? If he in fact He lives here, then he would have been created when the universe was created - as He is part of it<br /><br />Ok, so that does not work.<br /><br />He must live out side of our universe.<br /><br />But wait - if Time is an integral part of our universe, then he must live in a different time stream. If He lives in a different universe with different time, then how could he effect our universe with it's own time? If our time does not effect Him, then our universe would be created and destroyed in no time in His universe. So, if he were to have created our universe, it would be over before any time passed in his time stream.<br /><br />And, if he exists in another universe - what caused him? Every event has a cause, so what caused him? Did He have parents?<br /><br />-Tsyko</p>]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Richard Bach had an interesting analogy in his book Illusions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically he equated our lives/world with a movie and God or the God's or whatever's world with our world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The characters in the movie expirience time in a definate progression, from their point of view everything happens in order and the future is unpredictable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, someone outside, in the real world, sees the movie as being a static artifact.  The future is predictable, everthing is knowable.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be impossible for any of the characters inside the movie to determine anything for certain about the movie maker or what his world was like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course this analogy is imperfect.  Free will does not exist for the characters in a movie (although the illusion of it does) but it is an interesting way to think about this sort of problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course the ultimate answer is, &quot;It's a mystery.&quot;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps that is not very satisfing, but I for one am a little unwilling to abandon the idea at least that the mysterious and the unknowable may in fact exist.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I would agree that just because we cannot comprehend something does not make it untrue. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several issues with the motion picture analogy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, the watchers of the movie cannot effect the movie. The plot of the movie is already set in stone, as it were.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We can no more cause changes in the Matrix then an outsider could in that enviroment. If the outcome is already known, and the causes are already in place, then there is no wiggle room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, If the 'outsider' sees this world as a static artifact, and can 'fast forward' to see what the outcomes are, then we live in a deterministic world - everything is already determined and we have no choice in the matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The issue of free will is the crux of this matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess that I have a hard time with that. I would rather that my actions and choices were not pre-destined. If we destiny is in fact guiding our every act, thought and deed - then why should we try to better ourselves? Why should we attempt to reach beyond what we know?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A pre-destined world is a sad place to live, IMO. And we come a full 180 back to the question of suffering.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I did point out the free will problem in my original comment and I agree with you there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most useful thing about the analogy in my mind is that it does demonstrate well that a different persepective, a different frame of reference, can make the same thing look very different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From a movie watchers point of view a movie is much different from a movie character's point of view, even though the movie is the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One could probably better construct an analogy with a virtual reality world (even something like EverQuest or the Sims) with God being the designer/programmer and the characters being us humans.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kind of like the idea of us as humans (in the real world) having a strong analogy to this idea, where a portion of us is a mortal being (the character and part of the world) and a portion of us is immortal and outside of it (the human player behind the character.)]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[There's a third choice: what if God &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; the Universe?

For instance: are you inside or outside your body?  It's the exact same question.

Point to the part that contains &quot;you&quot;.  Which neuron is it?  Which part of the brain?  Which synapses?

Or are you just the sum of your perceptions?

Here's the basic problem with your question:
You understand Euclidean Geometry, right?
There are an infinite number of points in a line.  How can that be?  At some point, you should get to an ultimate 'smallness' and be able to start counting, right?  But that's just an aside.
So take that line of infinite points...and now, without leaving the line, describe a plane.
You can't do it.
You need at least two lines to describe a plane.
But from the perspective of a point, the plane doesn't exist; &lt;i&gt;can't&lt;/i&gt; exist.

Likewise, from points within that plane, attempt to describe a three-dimensional object.

Again, you can't do it.  The 3-D object &lt;i&gt;cannot&lt;/i&gt; be described with only two dimensions.

The 4th dimension is Time.  A solid object in and of itself cannot be described in 'time' without moving within that dimension.  We talk about 'along' the timestream, but that's just our perception, because we do move from the past to the future.

So, what if there were a fifth dimension (and I'm not talking about the soul group). How would you detect it or even know it was there?

Rather than trying to locate God in the dimensions you know, consider again:

Something that has freedom of motion in 3 dimensions would not be within the perceptions of something restricted to just 2.  You can see that right?  If you can't leave the plane you are in, how can you detect me when I leave the plane for a different, perpendicular plane?  I would cease to exist to your perceptions, but I would still perceive you, and be able to act on you.

I will spare you the same comparison between a plan and a line, and a line and point.

About suffering...well, is suffering always bad?  Have you ever worked out?  Some suffering leads to growth, and some suffering prevents even greater suffering later on.

Do you have kids?  Do you control every aspect of their lives to prevent any suffering whatsoever?  Does a 14-year-old who is prevented from going out with their friends &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; understand how minor that depravation is?  Probably not.

Have you ever known a person whose parents managed to prevent the child from experiencing even 10% of the normal suffering of life?  The ones &lt;i&gt;I've&lt;/i&gt; seen weren't worth a crap.

...and that's even aside from the idea that most of the suffering we experience in this life is due to the selfish decisions of sinful people.

That's only a scant introduction to the wonderful world of theology.  I'll be back to check your disagreements later. [grin] ]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[So, I should belive in something &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; it's not provable?

&quot;&lt;em&gt;Something that has freedom of motion in 3 dimensions would not be within the perceptions of something restricted to just 2. You can see that right? If you can't leave the plane you are in, how can you detect me when I leave the plane for a different, perpendicular plane? I would cease to exist to your perceptions, but I would still perceive you, and be able to act on you.&lt;/em&gt;&quot;

However, the flatlander would have no frame of refrence to even comprehend, let alone describe, the object that existed in 3D. So, logically, he could neiter prove nor disprove anything about it. It all comes down to Faith.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Faith: #  Belief that does not rest on logical proof or material evidence. See synonyms at belief, trust.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There is no way to hold a conherent discussion where one side is talking about logical reality and the other about Faith.

To quote a freind:

&quot;&lt;em&gt;I just don't understand any intellectual argument where a invisible deity is involved. What if I told you that I believe the Universe was spawned by a galactic chicken that, in a fit of extreme diarrhea, secreted the cosmos into being. This chicken now demanded gifts of grain annually after a good harvest to insure that next years harvest was bountiful as well. If next years harvest turns out to be bad, then we must have done something to displease the galactic chicken during the past year, and we must now spend 12 days wearing an outfit made from chicken feathers and come together in a pasture to worship him by flapping our arms up and down, scratching in the ground, and clucking?&lt;/em&gt;&quot;

You cannot disprove the Great Chicken. You might not belive that this is true, however there is no way that you can disprove it.

When someone plays the faith card in a logical discussion, it is tanatmount to them saying &quot;I cannot explain it, I just belive it&quot;. Sorry if that does not do it for me. :)

As in court, if some one is to make a claim - they should be able to defend that claim. If in a logical discussion, and they claim the existance of God, there should be some good logical evidence that is true. To just say &quot;Well, it might be like this&quot; is not enough. One should have a logical argument that stands up.

So, in summary - Yes, God could be a Nth dimensional creature that we cannot perceive. However, that does not change the fact that there is no evidence that he exists. Infact, there is evidence that He does not exist. I would ask for what emperical evidence that you have that He does in fact exist.]]></wp:comment_content>

Then see argument #1 - He is bound by time/space - which is part of Him. Logically, you just cannot excape this. If He is part of our universe, then he cannot be omni-whatever because He is bound by the laws of Time and Space that we know to exist.]]></wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From <a href=http://it.slashdot.org/it/05/02/18/1920244.shtml?tid=201&#38;tid=218>Slashdot</a>:<br /><br /><blockquote>The Inquirer has a story that the next generation of Windows spyware and exploits are starting to make use of 'kernel rootkits'. A paper at Microsoft Research has details on a prototype detection tool. Computerworld has more details, as well. From the article: 'Newer rootkits can intercept system calls that are passed to the kernel and filter out queries generated by the software. This makes them invisible to administrators and to detection tools...'</blockquote><br /><br />When are people going to wake up? The era of Windows as we know it is over. There is a race between the hackers and Microsoft, and Microsoft simply cannot keep up. So, I am going to buy a new computer. If I choose Windows, I have to also buy a virus scanner and a spyware scanner, and oh by the way, I might want to buy Office, and a backup program that works, and and and and...<br /><br />From an administrators standpoint, it is suicide to install windows. You simply <b>have</b> to install <span class="caps">SUS</span> or <span class="caps">WUS</span> (the <span class="caps">WUS</span> beta currently out requires a connection to a Microsoft <span class="caps">SQL</span> server), and it's a really good idea to install a centrally controlled workstation firewall, and virus scanner, and spyware scanner, and software inventory and control agent and and and...<br /><br />And yet people still recoil from the Mac, Linux and <span class="caps">BSD</span>. Why? Because 'they are not windows'. So, they spend and spend on all of the supporting infrastructure that running a somewhat secure Windows network requires.<br /><br />Here is a road map to the future for all of you companies stuck in the windows quagmire.<br /><br />1) Get all of you apps running on standards based web platforms (<i>ie</i> no ActiveX, VBScript etc). Use <span class="caps">PHP</span>, MySql and write to <span class="caps">HTML</span> specs.<br /><br />2) The apps that you cannot port to a N-Tier based architecture, get them running using a cross-platform coding tool (Mono w/ <span class="caps">GTK</span>, QT, or what have you).<br /><br />3) Swap out your applications with cross platform ones - ie use Firefox or Mozilla instead of IE. Use Open Office/Star Office instead of Microsoft Office. As your users become used to these tools, it will be trivial to swap out the underlying OS. Most might not even notice.<br /><br />4) Start moving your people to some thing else. - Move the light users first - the ones that only use word, email, and a browser. Power Users can come later. Choose something that keeps your options open - and provides real security.<br /><br />5) Sleep better at night knowing that you have a safer, more secure network.<br /><br />If you need help, email me :)<br /><br /><br />-Tsyko</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In my browsing, I stumbled on <a href=http://www.lex18.com/Global/story.asp?S=2989614>Scary Story</a>. Seems this kid in Highschool wrote a short story about a generic highschool being overrun by Zombies.<br /><br />So, he is being charged, and held for $5,000 bail. For writing a short story. For his English class. Wow.<br /><br />So, I started to do some research, and I found <a href="http://zerointelligence.net/">This Site</a>. Some good stuff there about the fear culture that we currently live in...<br /><br />-Tsyko</p>]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[(I posted this to the site-link about the fear culture.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have kids in public school.  I would darn well like to know that the students around them have enough sense to report the threat-makers when we're talking about BOMBS.  There is a huge difference between &quot;ratting&quot; on someone for a minor infraction, and going to the authorities with information about bomb threats made against public buildings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many of the rants posted so far here with this article are examples of people who have no use for the school system, people who feel the USA is somehow drifting towards a Nazi Germany type of government just because we have laws, or people who want to offer legal interpretations of the issues presented.  The issue here is far more basic...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...it's called &quot;social conscience.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's a big difference between reporting red-light-runners and kids who smoke a little pot (or, maybe even a lot of pot), and reporting kids who make bomb threats; kids who think it is somehow funny in this day-and-age of school shootings and terrorists flying planes into buildings to call in bomb threats at public institutions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is the discipline too harsh (a year of suspension)?  Maybe...but the notion that these kids are doing something noble by not reporting what they know about the bomb threats is unconscionable.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I agree that all credable threats should be investigated. I do not agree with knee-jerk reactions like&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;A fourth-grade student at Wakelee Elementary School in the Wolcott School District was suspended for 10 days for violating the school's zero tolerance policy against weapons. His mother had packed a Boy Scout utensil kit with his lunch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    His mother, Rebecca Glendening, said she thought she had removed the knife attached to the kit, but instead she had mistakenly removed a can-opener tool.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(from that site)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;or the Zombie story that I wrote about. One of my big beefs is that people are being lead to belive that anything that they feel is remotely diffrent should be slapped. If I write a story about Zombies, or if I play a D&amp;D game set in a 'school' - should I be cuffed in front of my peers and hauled off to jail?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There has to be some common sense applied. It's like the people who think that if you read Harry Potter you are a Satanist. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We cannot react to all threats equally - there has to be some triage going on. A bomb threat does not equal a short story about zombies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heh - sorry - rant mode off ;)]]></wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From <a href="http://www.unhappybirthday.com/">Unhappy Birthday</a><br /><blockquote> "Did you know Happy Birthday is copyrighted and the copyright is currently owned and actively enforced by Time Warner?<br /><br />Did you know that if you sing any copyrighted song:<br />...at a place open to the public<br />...or among a substantial number of people who are not family or friends<br />You are involved in a public performance of that work?<br /><br />Did you know an unauthorized public performance is a form of copyright infringement?"</blockquote><br /><br />You know, I had often wondered why many major chains (such as <a href = http://www.applebees.com/>Applebees) do not use the 'traditional' words. I had heard rumors before that the song was copyrighted, but I had never tracked down the reality of story. Enter <a href = http://mako.yukidoke.org/copyrighteous/projects/20050301-00.html>Mako</a>, your freindly neighboorhood anarchist. <br /><br />So, the moral of this story is this - If you sing Happy Birthday to your freind or family member in a public place, you can be sued for copyright infringement? Check out <a href = http://www.unhappybirthday.com/>Unhappy Birthday for the full scoop, and methods of turning in your freinds, foes and random people for this shocking crime!</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>(Read the full <a href=http://www.theonion.com/news/index.php?issue=4110>article - With Pictures</a>!)<br /><br /><blockquote>Bush announces Iraq Exit Strategy: We'll go through Iran<br /><br /><span class="caps">WASHINGTON</span>, DC â€” Almost a year after the cessation of major combat and a month after the nation's first free democratic elections, President Bush unveiled the coalition forces' strategy for exiting Iraq.<br /><br />"I'm pleased to announce that the Department of Defense and I have formulated a plan for a speedy withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq," Bush announced Monday morning. "We'll just go through Iran."<br /><br />Bush said the U.S. Army, which deposed Iran's longtime enemy Saddam Hussein, should be welcomed with open arms by the Islamic-fundamentalist state.<br /><br />"And Iran's so nearby," Bush said. "It's only a hop, skip, and a jump to the east.<br /></blockquote><br /><br />I commend Mr. Bush's decision to announce his exit strategy from Iraq. We have needed such a strategy for quite some time, and I think that the troops in the field and the people at home will laud accolades on Mr. Bush for this announcement.<br />We have needed an efficient and quick exit strategy for quite some time, and this fits the bill. Also, I think that Iran will lend us much assistance, as they must be relived that their long time foe, Saddam is gone.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, reading more and thinking more. That is always a dangerous combination. Here is what I am thinking about right now.<br /><br />Given that the universe is at least as <a href="http://www.encyclopedia.com/html/M/Machspri.asp">holistic</a> <a href="http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/physics/pdf/0112/0112094.pdf">as</a> <a href="http://citebase.eprints.org/cgi-bin/citations?id=oai:arXiv.org:gr-qc/9812003">modern</a> physics thinks it is, perhaps even more, what can we gain by exploring smaller and smaller parts of it to more and more resolution?<br /><br />I guess that the quandary is as follows. Every part of the universe, from the smallest particle can effect every other part of the universe. We are, in fact, all in this together. By segmenting our knowledge into smaller and smaller disciplines, are we in fact doing our greater good a disservice?<br /><br />To understand a system, be it a computer system, an engine, or a biosphere - one needs a high level understanding of how all of the pieces and parts interact.<br /><br />For example - you would never take you car to a person who only knew how spark plugs worked (but knew every last little detail about spark plugs) to get it fixed would you? You would want some one who had a general understanding of the entire thing worked.<br /><br />Same goes with modern science. We have people who are so tightly focused on their specialties that they cannot see the whole picture. We have people who only think about string theory and how it works, but know little about the structure of distant stars. I would think that generalists who have a good understanding of many fields of study (but not in depth) might be needed. If for nothing more then to keep abreast of all of the developments in all of the fields and try and see where one field might benefit from others.<br /><br />After all, we have seen that what is true at the microscopic can also be true at the macroscopic.<br /><br />-Tsyko</p>]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[So true you Tsyko.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;I saw a show on something like the Discover Channel where two brothers had gone into so completely different lines of work, or so they thought.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Now this story could be completely wrong, but it went something like this...&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;One brother was an eye doctor, and one a computer scientist.  One day they were at a family gathering when the eye doctor brought up a problem with one of his patience.  They both sat discussing it and soon found themselves working together on this problem.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;You see, the brother who worked in computers brought his knowledge of how computers &quot;see&quot; and the eye doctor was able to apply this research into making his patience see once again!&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Without these two brothers getting together this breakthrough may still be unknown to us.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;I think this plays into what the Duk was saying.  By understanding a larger chunk of the universe we can unravel more of its secrets.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I think that one of the challenges is that our understanding of the universe  is at such a detailed level, that a lifetimes work can be spent on the smallest detail.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;In my humble opinion, we need to start training generalists.

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I think that both efforts are important.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;As far as training goes though, I don't know how you can properly train a generalist, or a (a term I prefer) synethesizer.  Obviously, it is easy to train someone to know a little about a lot of things, but to get something from that you need a unique mind and usually a pretty detailed knowledge of at least one thing.  Since you don't know ahead of time what disciplines will combine together to create a new synthesis training for this is tough.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Obviously you also need the backup of people who DO know a lot about all the detailed things as well, to actually make it work.  I wouldn't want my mechanic to just know about spark plugs, but I would certainly want the spark plug maker he buys them from to know EVERYTHING about spark plugs.]]></wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.wyp-ptm.org/">Physics for the Third Millennium</a><br /><br /><blockquote>In February 1998, Marshall Space Flight Center's Science Directorate hosted a Workshop/Training Conference which invited leading physicists to meet with Marshall researchers about the cutting-edge issues in the world of physics at the dawn of the new millennium. Seven lectures covered a variety of topics at the edge of knowledge.<br /><br />The Science Directorate is organizing a follow-on conference to again bring together leading physicists to participate in a series of lectures on open issues in physics in 2005. The intended audience is wider and the number of participants greater than at the 1998 meeting but the range of topics will be as exciting. We hope to bring together leaders in the fields who can discuss such topics as What is Gravity, Dark Matter and Energy, Neutrino Physics, Issues in Quantum Physics, String Theories and New Dimensions, Physics of High Energies and Temperatures, A Century of Relativity, Where Physics and Biology Meet, and others yet to be defined.<br /><br />A major feature of this meeting is the addition of a significant education component to the meeting goals and venue. We are bringing the lecturers together with students and teachers with the hope of putting a human face to the world of physics.</blockquote><br /><br />Oooooohhh. Can I go?</p>]]></content:encoded>

<title>F/OSS vs Commercial development theories</title>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href=http://www.osnews.com/editor.php?editors_id=1>Eugenia</a> posted an <a href=http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=9933>article</a> a few days ago, and then <a href=http://www.expert-zone.com/index.php?module=announce&#38;ANN_user_op=view&#38;ANN_id=750&#38;4ae6d70e6dc49027d85e12bb2dd15191=19155f6cc836bb9d8ed256cf68c4d5a9>another</a> was posted and the lists started up and another etc...<br /><br />The short and long of the entire thing is that Eugenia feels that F/OSS developers are not as open to feature requests as Commerical developers. I tend to agree with her. F/OSS developers tend to 'scratch their itches' and not mine or yours. They are not paid for their efforts after all.<br /><br />If you want a customer centeric experince, look into customer driven software. One where the developers have a vested intrest in developing for their clients. <a href=http://www.kde.org><span class="caps">KDE</span></a> and <a href=http://www.gnome.org>Gnome</a> are good examples. Many of <span class="caps">KDE</span>'s developers are employed by <a href=http://www.suse.com>SuSE</a> and <a href=http://www.novell.com>Novell</a>. Many Gnome devlopers are employed by Novell and <a href=http://www.canonical.com/>Canonical</a>.<br /><br />But, wait, those are F/OSS software, right? Right!<br /><br />Most major F/OSS projects are sponsored by large, paying companies. If you support those companies, you support those projects. You gain a more powerful voice with the project to see your goals met.<br /><br />So, the moral of the story is as follows. If you love using F/OSS software, and are happy with it, great. Support the companies that support the software, or donate.<br /><br />If some very important feature is missing, add it yourself, or support one of the companies, and tell them what you want.<br /><br />As an aside, <a href=http://www.theopencd.org/>The Open CD</a> is a good thing. Go, download it and check it out. Some really cool F/OSS software for windows there. Go - get it!<br /><br />-Tsyko</p>]]></content:encoded>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to the <a href="http://www.eds.com/services/alliances/agility/">Agility Alliance</a>, <br /><br /><blockquote>From a corporate perspective, we are not confident where Linux is right now today. A large enterprise needs to be sure because it relates to securifying [sic] the environment. We see some of the same things occurring that did to Unix <del>- it could splinter into many different types of languages. We are quite cautious about Linux and its deployment</blockquote><br /><br />and<br /><br /><blockquote>We are concerned about security on an open standard environment like that. We are also concerned about some of the scalability issues that we are seeing on our clients on a global basis. Also, we are somewhat cautious about what happened with Unix , it splintered into eight applications -</del> until McNealy (Scott McNealy, chief executive of Sun) finally announced he won the battle and had the one surviving Unix out there. We think Linux has the possibility of going the same route</blockquote><br /><br />and<br /><br /><blockquote>If you test Red Hat against Solaris 10 against whatever elseâ€¦ we would say that Solaris 10 beats it hands down on functionality and everything else</blockquote><br /><br />(all from <a href=http://www.zdnet.com.au/news/software/0,2000061733,39184795,00.htm>this</a> article ad ZDNet)<br /><br />So, these guys are saying that Linux is not scaleable, and insecure, and we should use <a href=http://www.sun.com>Sun</a>'s <a href=http://www.sun.com/software/solaris/index.jsp>Solaris</a> instead.<br /><br />I found it funny that the Members of this "<a href=http://www.eds.com/services/alliances/agility/>Agility Alliance" include <a href=http://www.sun.com>Sun</a> and <a href=http://www.microsoft.com>Microsoft</a>, both companies that would profit greatly from the demise of Linux.<br /><br />I also found it funny to find the following article just two above on <a href=http://www.osnews.com>OSNews</a>:<br /><br /><blockquote>The homegrown Linux operating system has come a long way from its origins as a college kid's pet project and computer hobbyist favorite. Refined in recent years by professional computer programmers at <span class="caps">IBM</span>, Hewlett-Packard, Novell and Red Hat, Linux now has become so technically powerful that it lays claim to a prestigious title-<a href=http://www.forbes.com/home/enterprisetech/2005/03/15/cz_dl_0315linux.html>it runs more</a> of the world's top supercomputers than any other OS.</blockquote><br /><br />Also - guys, Sun does not own Unix. There are several flavors of Unix still out there - <span class="caps">AIX</span>, HP/UX, <span class="caps">BSD</span> and (shudders) <span class="caps">SCO</span> to name a few..<br /><br />Get your facts "straightified" before you start to pop off with stuff like this. <br /><br />So - who we gonna trust? Sun and Microsoft or Forbes?<br /><br />-Tsyko</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A friend and I were talking, when I brought up the topic of using Ogg files instead of <span class="caps">MP3</span>'s. As his iRiver supports Ogg, I chided him on his use of <span class="caps">MP3</span>'s.<br /><br />He asked what was wrong with <span class="caps">MP3</span>'s. I explained that the format was encumbered by patents and costs. He responded 'So?'<br /><br />So? I was at a loss for words.<br /><br />So, I decided to find out why.<br /><br />I will start with the social issues, and then wander towards the technical issues.<br /><br /><blockquote>Digital technology and network distribution has removed the middleman between the artist and the music listener, but the content industry wants to put the middleman back in place. They can do this with the help of a proprietary music format and software that they can control, with artificial restrictions to limit its potential.</blockquote><br />(From <a href=http://mondodesigno.com/music/ogg.htm>Daniel James</a>)<br /><br />It's all about the bucks. The content providers make a ton of money right now off of audio CD sales. They are not going to if the artists can interact directly with the consumers.<br /><br /><blockquote>All of the money advanced by the record company to the act has to be paid back by the act from it's small percentage of the CD returns. This percentage can be as low as 5%. Consequently, record companies are always in profit a long time before acts are, if they ever are.</blockquote><br />(From <a href=http://www.abc.net.au/arts/music/stories/s913325.htm><span class="caps">ABC</span> Australia</a>)<br /><br /><blockquote>With the advent of digital music, the content industry thinks that it can massively increase profits by eliminating the costs associated with conventional music distribution on physical media.</blockquote><br />(From <a href=http://mondodesigno.com/music/ogg.htm>Daniel James</a>)<br /><br /><blockquote>Another advantage over <span class="caps">MP3</span> is that Vorbis sounds better, and its smaller. There's two sides of that scale - either it's smaller or it sounds better. Vorbis can get a little smaller and still sound better than <span class="caps">MP3</span>, or it can get a lot smaller and still sound pretty good.</blockquote><br />(From <a href=http://mondodesigno.com/music/interview.html>Jack Moffitt</a>)<br /><br /><blockquote>I'm a music fan. Why should I be interested? <br /><br />Because Vorbis provides a high-quality format for you to listen to your music. <br />For a given file size, Vorbis sounds better than <span class="caps">MP3</span>. This means: You can keep your music collection at about the same quality level, but it'll take up less space or you can have your music collection take up about the same amount of space, but have it sound better. Vorbis already enjoys widespread player support and work is underway to play Vorbis files on portable hardware.</blockquote><br />(From <a href=http://www.vorbis.com/faq.psp#fan>Vorbis</a>)<br /><br />I am ripping at an Ogg quality of 8, and I am getting about 6 megs per song. Sammy Hagar's Heavy Metal is 6.07 megs in size. I am going to set it back down to 6.  I ripped that song at 8 and at 6, and I could not hear a difference.<br /><br /><a href=http://www.xiph.org/ogg/vorbis/listen.html>Dare to compare</a> the difference between the formats.<br /><br />-Tsyko</p>]]></content:encoded>

Try hitting the snooze bar again now!'</blockquote><br /><br />Anyone that knows me, knows that I simply have to get one. That's too cool! Imagine the possibilities - you could set traps for it (<i>If I pile the clothes like this, when it jumps off the nightstand it will get stuck</i> or <i>Well, you see the alarm clock jumps down and hits this lever which trips this fan which blows this wirlygig which turns this crank which drops this ball into this track which rolls down and moves this seesaw which pushes this rod up which dumps this bucket of water into this other bucket which swings across the room which pushes this lever which turns on the coffee machine.</i>)<br /><br /><br />-Tsyko</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4379371.stm">Let fans decide on digital rights</a><br /><br /><blockquote>The argument over the use of digital rights management (DRM) to control the distribution and use of music and other content took an interesting turn this week...<br /><br />...What Jon and his fellow programmers have done is work out exactly what information the iTunes client sends to the store, and what responses it gets back when someone buys a song and downloads it.<br /><br />Jon earned the nickname "DVD Jon" for his exploits<br />Then they have written their own program that does all of the same things with one key exception: their code does not add the FairPlay digital rights management wrapper to the downloaded music file.<br /><br />Instead of having to accept the limitations that Apple has placed on what you can do with the music you have purchased, you can use your own judgment as to what is fair and legal...<br /><br />...It is great having people like Jon around because he combines astonishing technical ability with devotion to the spirit of copyright law and the importance of "fair use" rights.<br /><br />That is, the freedom to do things like make copies for personal use, or keep backups, or just play music on any computer or portable player you happen to own.<br /><br />For him, the purpose of PyMusique is not to encourage people to break copyright law but to point out how technology is being used to take away freedoms that we should be fighting to preserve.  </blockquote><br /><br />I agree with what the article says. Apple's 'FairPlay', and indeed any <span class="caps">DRM</span> scheme is destined for failure. Why should I buy a tune from Apple, when I cannot play it on my iRiver? When I cannot use my Linux box to play it on my Home Stereo?<br /><br /><blockquote>here is a simple solution for those who, like me, disagree with Apple's approach to selling music online and that is not to buy any.<br /><br />I do not buy locked-down music, so I will not buy songs from iTunes or anywhere else that limits what I can do with them.<br /><br />Instead, I use sites like <a href="http://www.betterpropaganda.com/">betterPropaganda</a>, which have indie artists and unlocked files.<br /><br />But most of the time I simply buy CDs and rip them to my hard drive.<br /><br />I get the artwork, I get a high quality copy of the music that I can re-copy at any time if I should lose my digital version, and I get a music file I can play on any device I choose, now or in the future.</blockquote><br /><br />That's what I do. I do not share my <a href="http://tsykoduk.blogspot.com/2005/03/gimme-my-ogg.html">Ogg</a> files with folks that do not own the CD, and I only play them in my truck, or on my home system, or when <span class="caps">I DJ</span> Raves.<br /><br />Just kidding about that last one.<br /><br />Or am I?<br /><br />-Tsyko</p>]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I been been interested in the digital rights/copywrite debate for a long time now.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;My conclusion, provisionally at least, is that we may need to abandon the concept of 'fair use'.  I am not entirely happy about this, but technological changes have always resulted in changes in copywrite law, and I think this might be a needed rememedy.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;I think that there would be less anger if the concept that you were purchasing use of a song on a particular machine, rather than purchasing the song itself, and that  it would go along way to solve a lot of these issues.  &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Now, whether the price for a song on a single machine should still be a buck or if it should be less as a result is a different issue.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Well, if I can buy a CD that I can use in any CD Player for 15 bucks, and it has 10 - 15 songs on it (about an hour's music) the asking .99 for a song that I can only play with one application on one computer is pretty poor.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;I think that we need to keep the idea of fair use. If I pay money for something, then I should be able to use it, no?&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;I guess I just feel that when I buy a thing, that I should have ownership of that thing. If that thing is a copyable thing, and the license that I buy it under says that I am not to give it to others, then I do not give it to others. If I do, I should be held accountable under the law.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;I am not saying that Apple is Evil for selling their songs like this, just that I will not buy them. If I had all windows and Apple at home, this would not be such an issue.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;So, I still buy CD's, I rip them onto my harddrive and use them that way. I guess that it's just personal choice now.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;What I do not look forward to is a day when we &quot;abandon the concept of 'fair use'&quot;. If CD's are no longer sold, I will have to bow to the mass media and get the songs from iTunes, or Wallmart online or what ever. But you can bet that I will be working at removing the DRM wrappers so that I can enjoy them on my Linux boxes, my Home Stereo and in my Truck...]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Assuming you could purchase single machine downloads for all the machines you desire to have the music on (yes a big assumption) there is obviously a price point at which you would prefer cheaper, multiple downloads to a single multi-use download.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;If for example you could download a song to 5 machines for 10 cents each, or download a multi-use version for a dollar, most people would probably pich the single use downloads.  Fairly quickly I expecet that the multi-use services would disappear for lack of a sufficient audience.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;I expect also that the companies would make a whole lot more money off of 10 cents per download per machine than they do from the current 1 dollar per song.  Not because people have more than 10 machines, but because they would download a lot more songs, more frequently.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Or, I can pay $15 for a physical CD, rip it,  play it anywhere, anytime, &lt;B&gt;and&lt;/B&gt; have a physical backup that will last 20 some odd years.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;I agree that at a certian price point it will work - Heck, iTunes is at most folks price point right now. That is one rocking service.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;I guess that I am not trying to convince people to not use it - just be aware of the licensing restrictions.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;That is what it comes down to with Any IP/DRM/License. Be aware of what you are buying. I feel that people should have the freedom to use any licensing scheme that they want for their creative work. However, they should also respect the licenses of the IP that they use in their works.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;So if Band A or Record Label A wants to release all of their music via DRM that restricts their use to only the Purple iPods, great! I will not buy it, but that should be their choice.]]></wp:comment_content>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I, <i><em>_</i><i>_</em></i><i><em>_</i><i>_</em></i>_ (fill in the blank), being of sound mind and body, unequivocally declare that in the event of a catastrophic injury, I do not wish to be kept alive indefinitely by artificial means. I hereby instruct my loved ones and relatives to remove all life-support systems, once it has been determined that my brain is longer functioning in a cognizant realm. However, that judgment should be made only after thorough consultation with medical experts; i.e., individuals who actually have been trained, educated and certified as doctors.<br /><br />Under no circumstances <del>- and I can't state this too strongly -</del> should my fate be put in the hands of peckerwood politicians who couldn't pass ninth-grade biology if their lives depended on it. Furthermore, it is my firm hope that, when the time comes, any discussion about terminating my medical treatment should remain private and confidential.<br /><br />Living in Florida, however, I am acutely aware that the legislative and executive branches of state government are fond of meddling in family matters, and have little concern for the privacy and dignity of individuals.<br /><br />Therefore, I wish to make my views on this subject as clear and unambiguous as possible. Recognizing that some politicians seem cerebrally challenged themselves (and with no medical excuse), I'll try to keep this simple and to the point:<br /><br />1. While remaining sensitive to the feelings of loved ones who might cling to hope for my recovery, let me state that if a reasonable amount of time passes  <del>- say, <em>__</em> (fill in the blank) months -</del> and I fail to sit sit up and ask for a cold beer, it should be presumed that I won't ever get better. When such a determination is reached, I hereby instruct my spouse, children and attending physicians to pull the plug, reel in the tubes and call it a day.<br /><br />2. Under no circumstances shall the members of the Legislature enact a special law to keep me on life-support machinery. It is my wish that these boneheads mind their own damn business, and pay attention instead to the health, education and future of the millions of Floridians who aren't in a permanent coma.<br /><br />3. Under no circumstances shall the governor of Florida butt into this case and order my doctors to put a feeding tube down my throat or through a hole into my abdomen to keep me alive. I don't care how many fundamentalist votes he's trying to scrounge for his run for the presidency in 2008, it is my wish that he plays politics with someone else's life and leaves me to die in peace.<br /><br />4. I couldn't care less if a hundred religious zealots send e-mails to legislators in which they pretend to care about me. I don't know these people, and I certainly haven't authorized them to preach and crusade on my behalf. They should mind their own business, too.<br /><br />5. It is my heartfelt wish to expire quietly and without a public spectacle. This is obviously impossible once elected officials become involved. So, while recognizing the wrenching emotions that attend the prolonged death of a loved one, I hereby instruct my relatives to settle all disagreements about my care in private or in the courts, as provided by law. If any of my family goes against my wishes and turns my case into a political cause, I hereby promise to come back from the grave and make his or her existence a living Hell.<br /><br />Hat Tip <a href=http://sharpmarbles.stufftoread.com/archive/2005/03/31/2820.aspx>Sharp as a Marble</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In an very good peice on Taxes, <a href="http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/tribune-review/opinion/columnists/will/s_318862.html">George F. Will</a> says<br /><br /><blockquote><br />The power to tax involves, as Chief Justice John Marshall said, the power to destroy. So does the power of tax reform, which is one reason why Rep. John Linder, a Georgia Republican, has a 133-page bill to replace 55,000 pages of tax rules.<br /><br />His bill would abolish the <span class="caps">IRS</span> and the many billions of tax forms it sends out and receives. He would erase the federal income tax system <del>- personal and corporate income taxes, the regressive payroll tax and self-employment tax, capital gains, gift and estate taxes, the alternative minimum tax and the earned income tax credit -</del> and replace all that with a 23 percent national sales tax on personal consumption...<br /><br />..Today the percentage of taxpayers who rely on professional tax preparers is at an all-time high. The 67 percent of tax filers who do not itemize may think they avoid compliance costs, which include nagging uncertainty about whether one has properly complied with a tax code about the meaning of which experts differ. But everyone pays the cost of the tax system's vast drag on the economy.<br /><br />Linder says Americans spend 7 billion hours a year filling out <span class="caps">IRS</span> forms and at least that much calculating the tax implications of business decisions. Economic growth suffers because corporate boards waste huge amounts of time on such calculations rather than making economically rational allocations of resources...<br /><br />...Corporations do not pay payroll and income taxes and compliance costs, they collect them from consumers through prices. So the 23 percent consumption tax would allow taxpayers to stop paying the huge embedded cost of corporate taxation.<br /><br />Linder says the director of the Congressional Budget Office told him it costs individuals and businesses about $500 billion to remit $2 trillion to Washington. And studies show that it costs the average small business $724 to collect and remit $100...<br /><br />...Furthermore, by ending payroll and corporate taxes, America would become the only nation selling goods with no tax component <del>- such as Europe's value added tax -</del> in their prices. With no taxes on capital and labor, multinationals would, Linder thinks, stampede to locate here, which would be an incentive for other nations to emulate America. "This," Linder says, "would unleash freedom around the globe."<br /><br />Critics argue that ending the income tax, with its deductibility of charitable contributions, would depress giving. Piffle, Linder says. In 1980, when the top personal income tax rate was 70 percent, a huge incentive for giving, individual charitable contributions were $40.7 billion. In 1986 the top rate was reduced to 28 percent and by 1988 charitable giving was $86.7 billion. The lesson, says Linder, is that we give more money when we have more money. </blockquote><br /><br />This is something that I have been railing about for years now. I think this is a great idea! The more money you put into consumer's hands, the more they are going to spend. Or, more importantly, save. A stronger savings will allow more Venture Capital to fund more of what the US is so good at - ideas. <br /><br />Hat Tip <a href=davejustus.blogspot.com>Dave</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Check <a href=http://www.buddhanet.net/flash/rahula/rahula.html>This</a> out...<br /><br />It's simple lessons like this that we need to learn. Often when I am wrapped up in my life and my problems, I am like Leo - not wanting to help, not thinking before acting. By training myself to be mindful, I can learn to float above the feelings that are generated in daily life. I still experience them, I still feel them, but they no longer dictate my actions. I am not ruled by my gut, but rather by my reason. I react not out of momentary passion, but out of thoughtfulness.<br /><br />-Tsyko</p>]]></content:encoded>

<blockquote>Odin's Raven writes "Opera Software's R-and-D department today announced the discovery of a new technology dubbed 'Opera SoundWave' - a platform-independent speech solution for short- and medium-range interpersonal communication. Based on open standards, Opera's patent-pending <span class="caps">P2P</span> speech technology uses analogue signals carried through open air, enabling users to communicate in real- time without the use of computers or mobile phones. Details (including link to tech preview) are available in their press release. I wonder how long it will be before a <span class="caps">FOSS</span> implementation of this technology emerges?"</blockquote>

	<p>Wow. that sounds really cool. I think that it could totally change the world, the way that we communicate and everything else. I think this is going to be big...</p>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From <a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1781171,00.asp">Eweek</a></p>


<blockquote>A pair of newly discovered security flaws in Microsoft's Internet Explorer and Outlook programs could put millions of users at risk of code execution attacks, a private research outfit warned Thursday.</blockquote>

	<p>This is part for the course - we expect there to be serious security flaws in Microsoft products.</p>


<blockquote>Marc Maiffret, chief hacking officer at eEye, said the flaws were rated "high-severity" because malicious hackers could run a successful exploit from anywhere on the Internet.

	<p>"These are client-side vulnerabilities that could allow attacks via a Web browser or the Outlook client. The risk of a zero-day attack is quite high," Maiffret said in an interview with eWEEK.com.</p>


	<p>He said Microsoft was alerted to the first vulnerability March 16. </blockquote></p>


	<p>March 16th? That's 16 days ago? Must be a biggie!</p>


<blockquote>A spokeswoman for the software giant confirmed that engineers at the Microsoft Security Research Center were investigating the eEye discoveries.

	<p>"At this time, Microsoft is not aware of any malicious attacks attempting to exploit the reported vulnerabilities, and there is no customer impact based on this issue," she said.</p>


	<p>Once the investigation is done, she said Microsoft would "take the appropriate action" to protect affected users.</blockquote></p>


	<p>They are <i>investigating</i>? What? 16 days and no patch?</p>


	<p>Microsoft is in serious trouble. To properly secure their OS, they need to re-write it from the ground up. But they cannot take the time to do that, as there are other OS's breathing down their neck. If they took a year off, and rewrote windows they would be two years behind (they are already at least a year behind Apple and the <span class="caps">FOSS</span> community). So they are stuck - keep developing Longhorn - keep slashing features from it and trying to shore up the issues that they already see coming, or drop it, and re-write the whole shebang. They have already basically lost the war in the web server market - Apache rules there with an iron fist. They are taking heat on the browser side, with Firefox and Opera starting to make serious inroads. Open Office is sniffing around at their flanks. Things are starting to look grim for the Faithful in Redmond.</p>


	<p>But, perhaps this is not as it looks at first. Taking into account that Bill <a href="http://aroundcny.com/technofile/texts/tec091999.html">said he was going to give his money away</a>, perhaps this is just a plot. If Microsoft were to fail, he could walk away with a hefty sum of money and claim that he kept his word!</p>


	<p>Conspiracy theory's aside, the technical challenges faced by Microsoft are immense. The choices that they are faced with are really tough - keep the old, or develop the new? My guess is that they stay the course.</p>]]></content:encoded>

	<p>The popular Astronomoy Picture of the Day page has photographic proof of water on mars. It will be a little difficult for those of you who don't have a degree on geology to spot the evidence, but with a little effort, I think you'll be able to make it out.</p>

<title>Open Office 2 Pre-Review</title>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, I have been using <span class="caps">RC1</span> of Open Office 2 for a few weeks now, and I just wanted to take some time to jot down some opinions.</p>


	<p>The interface is much cleaner then the 1.x era of Open Office. I must say that I really like it. The buttons are sharp and clean, and colorful. In the menus, they display the button icons next to the command, so it makes finding things easier.</p>


	<p>As far as stability, I have had no crashes with it at all. Considering this is a beta release, I am very happy with that. Still available is the <span class="caps">PDF</span> creator. The font wizard is pretty cool as well, allowing you to download and install <span class="caps">LGPL</span> fonts directly into Open Office.</p>


	<p>It seems to do a better job of importing and exporting from the Microsoft Office file formats then the older version. Excel to Open office is still lacking , only in the artistic area. I like using drop shadows when I create forms in spreadsheets. Open office does not yet support that. It's a little feature, but one that I am looking forward to.</p>


	<pre><code>I currently am running it on Windows XP SP2. Due to some of the <a href="http://software.newsforge.com/software/05/03/22/204244.shtml?tid=93">core features</a> being implemented in Java, however, getting it onto a Linux box might entail some work (installing the Java Runtime and then the Open Office package by hand), but that is work that I am going to do as soon as the full 2.o is out.</code></pre>]]></content:encoded>

<title>Feds Hack Wireless Network in 3 Minutes</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://hardware.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/04/05/1428250&#038;from=rss">From Slashdot..</a></p>


<blockquote>from the still-can't-balance-budget dept.
xs3 writes At a recent <span class="caps">ISSA</span> (Information Systems Security Association) meeting in Los Angeles, a team of <span class="caps">FBI</span> agents demonstrated current <span class="caps">WEP</span>-cracking techniques and broke a 128 bit <span class="caps">WEP</span> key in about three minutes. Special Agent Geoff Bickers ran the Powerpoint presentation and explained the attack, while the other agents (who did not want to be named or photographed) did the dirty work of sniffing wireless traffic and breaking the <span class="caps">WEP</span> keys. <a href="http://www.tomsnetworking.com/Sections-article111.php">This article</a> will be a general overview of the procedures used by the <span class="caps">FBI</span> team.</blockquote>

	<p>And people think that I am paranoid for running a firewall between my Wireless and Wired LANs.</p>


	<p>Next step for me is <span class="caps">IPSEC</span>/VPN thru the firewall for access from my laptop. I will have it set up so that I can access my files and printers from anywhere with an internet connection. But first I have to re-wire the house.. :)</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Seattle Times: Local News:<a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2002230443_webtaxhike04.html">The  Senators propose multiyear, 15-cent gas tax hike</a>
<blockquote><span class="caps">OLYMPIA: </span> Senate transportation leaders today proposed a 15 cent per gallon increase in the state gasoline tax, to be slowly phased in over the next 12 years.</blockquote>
Um.. Wow – we already pay $.28 a gallon in taxes on fuel, and now they want to tack on another $.15? Thats $.43 a gallon in taxes alone.

More then likely, the answer is not new and higher taxes, but rather a re-allocation of existing funds.

<a href="http://dor.wa.gov/Docs/Pubs/ExciseTax/FilTaxReturn/MajorTaxes.htm">Washington State took in $752,000,000</a> in Fuel Tax in ‘03. Assuming that everything stays the same, they want us to pay out $1,150,000,000 in fuel taxes!
<blockquote>The plan also includes a gross-weight fee on cars, sports utility vehicles and small trucks, as well as local-option tax increases for cities and counties.</blockquote>
So our tabs are on the way up as well. What happened to the Flat Tabs?

This is just getting silly. Higher and more complex taxes do not engender a stronger economy – they weaken it. We need to take the message to Olympia – No More Taxes! Spend the billions that you take in as if it were your paycheck! No more stupid spending.]]></content:encoded>

<title>More about Gas Taxes</title>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><a href="http://www.heritage.org/Research/Taxes/wm451.cfm">An Increase in the Gas Tax Would Hurt Consumers and Slow the Economy</a>
Some leaders in Congress want to increase the federal tax on gasoline by 5.45 cents per gallon, for the first year, and then index it to inflation. They would use the revenue from this tax increase to finance additional spending on highways and other transportation projects, which they say will benefit the economy. Macroeconomic analysis performed by the Center for Data Analysis at the Heritage Foundation, however, shows that increasing the gas tax would depress economic activity and the incomes of millions of Americans. It would also raise significantly less revenue than its proponents project. The President should be commended for his firm stand against raising the federal gasoline tax, and Congress would do well to abandon proposals to increase the gas tax and instead focus on spending highway dollars more efficiently, ideally by turning them back to the states.
</blockquote>

	<p>If gas taxes do not work on a federal level, how can they work at a state?</p>


<center><a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/transportation/215368_transpo10.html"><img src="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/dayart/20050310/fuel-tax-0310.gif" alt="Gas Tax History - Seattle PI" /></a></center>

	<p>Takeaway - The national average is 23.7 cents a gallon, and right now, we pay 28 cents a gallon. And they want to tack another 15 cents a gallon on top of that.</p>


	<p>Let's talk about budget.</p>


	<p>According to <a href="http://www.ofm.wa.gov/budget/highlights/assets/pdf/highlights.pdf">the State</a>  we will be paying 4.6 billion in health care costs for 1 million people. As we have 6 million residents, 1 in 6 people are getting health care from the state.</p>


	<p>Instead of spending that 4.6 <strong>billion</strong> on bandaids why not find the root of the problem? Why can 1 in 6 people not afford health care? What can we, as a community, do to help these people get the satisfaction of paying their own way?</p>


<blockquote>'There is something wrong with the priorities of a state that denies children health care.â€

-Gov. Christine Gregoire
</blockquote>

	<p>The State does not deny children health care! They State is not an insurance company, nor is it a hospital. It is a State Government. If the state wants to insure that children have health care, then it needs to generate the opportunities the children's parents need to provide good homes and basic health care for them.</p>


	<p>So, we could more then likely carve the 500 million out of health care alone that they are looking for to improve roads and build new bridges.</p>


	<p>However, I know that I am shouting into the wind. After all, <a href="http://www.bartleby.com/73/424.html">Alexander Fraser Tytler</a> said it best:</p>


<blockquote>A democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government. It can only exist until the voters discover that they can vote themselves largesse from the public treasury. From that moment on, the majority always votes for the candidates promising the most benefits from the public treasury with the result that a democracy always collapses over loose fiscal policy, always followed by a dictatorship. The average age of the world's greatest civilizations has been 200 years.

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[By knowing the risks, we can then take action to mitigate them. To few people understand the danger of government entitlements, however. Or, perhaps they do, and want everyone's but theirs cut back.

That is the largest problem with cutting the size of government and it's budget. Everyone is ok with cutting the programs that they do not care about. But some one cares about every program. So, if you cut one program, then you anger the people who cared about it. They say 'Why Us?' and run a candidate who supports the Woolly Kitten Rescue Program.

The only way to actually be fair about it is to cut them all at once. Then no one can cry foul, or prejudiced or anything else.

Who has the political balls to do that though?]]></wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is a good <a href="http://www.2cpu.com/articles/113_1.html">Home Theatre PC Guide</a> out there. What they talk about is how to build a Home Theater PC - more then  just a <a href="http://www.tivo.com">TiVO</a>. You will be able to record TV to a digital format, display photos, play your Sound Files. It is a one stop shop.</p>


	<p>I think that I am going to build one some day. I have a few old PC's that need a home :)</p>]]></content:encoded>

	<p><em><center>When chapman billies leave the street,
And drouthy neibors, neibors, meet;
As market days are wearing late,
And folk begin to tak the gate,
While we sit bousing at the nappy,
An' getting fou and unco happy,
We think na on the lang Scots miles,
The mosses, waters, slaps and stiles,
That lie between us and our hame,
Where sits our sulky, sullen dame,
Gathering her brows like gathering storm,
Nursing her wrath to keep it warm. </center></em></p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.blogger.com">Blogger</a> is having major issues.</p>


	<p>I had my blog over there for quite a while, and honestly, I liked it. It was simple, effective and all in all a good thing.</p>


	<p>But <a href="http://www.blogger.com">Blogger</a> has grown too fast. They are having serious preformance issues. The commenting system crashes. There are no ping/trackbacks. They post <em>"it's a free service, don't complain"</em>. If I could have signed up for a pay account that actually worked, I would have. I really liked their software (except the trackback issue). I hated the cronic slowness and other problems.</p>


	<p>So, I got <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>.</p>


	<p>I put the problems squarely in the lap of <a href="http://www.blogger.com">Blogger.</a> They are now <a href="http://weblog.siliconvalley.com/column/dangillmor/archives/000802.shtml">owned</a> by <a href="http://www.google.com">Google.</a> Why not add a few hundred servers? Why not charge for premium accounts, and funnel that money back into expansion?</p>


	<p>Excuses aside, they are providing a service. If they expect to keep their good name, the service needs to meet expectations. If it does not, people will not use their service.</p>


	<p>Here's to hoping that <a href="http://www.blogger.com">blogger</a> will get it together and fix their issues - they have done a lot to advance blogging, and they could become a force to be reckoned with in the blogosphere. Heres hoping that they come back in full force.</p>

<blockquote>
But you'd think one thing that opponents of ID (like myself) should invoke more often are the examples of downright shoddy design put forth by the creator of the universe. The design of the human testicles, for instance. Here we have one of the primary reproductive organs located in a sac outside of the body and very, very vulnerable to damage. Why? Because human sperm can't be produced at normal human body temperature! That doesn't seem like intelligent design to me.</blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://vodkapundit.com/archives/007746.php">Vodkapundit - Rebuild Them</a></p>


<blockquote>We visited the <span class="caps">WTC</span> site after the attacks. On the plywood barrier next to the site people wrote personal messages. One of them struck a chord with me: it defiantly said, "It's still New York."

	<p>I like the idea to rebuild the towers. Yes, almost 3000 people died that day: more than the number that died at Pearl Harbor. Rebuilding the towers says, "You can't beat us. You can't even slow us down." The enemy attacked building that were symbols. Fine. Rebuild the symbols they hate.</p>


	<p><strong>I wouldn't put anti-aircraft guns on the top floor.</p>


	<p>I would move the UN into one of the buildings.</strong></blockquote></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>(This is a repost from my old site, but it is still relevant)</p>


	<p>So, the Bush Whitehouse has announced that they are going to put 1 billion dollars into researching hydrogen fueled personal vehicles. I have issues with this. I honestly think that it is a waste of money.</p>


	<p>We have an existing infrastructure that costs billions of dollars to put in place. We have an automotive industry that is tooled around building internal combustion engines. Why would we want to spend the money to retool this entire infrastructure?</p>


	<p>There is another option out there. Modern diesel engines are very fuel efficient, and when coupled with Biodiesel fuel they are very environmentally friendly.</p>


	<p>Volkswagen makes a model of their Jetta with a 2L <a href="http://www.tdiclub.com/TDIFAQ/TDiFAQ-1.html"><span class="caps">TDI</span> (Turbo Diesel Injected</a>) engine that gets 50 mpg freeway and town. Couple that with a 14-gallon tank, and you have quite the cruising range. My <span class="caps">F250</span> gets 16 in town and 20 on the freeway - pretty good for a 7.3L V8 with 525 f/lbs of torque. <a href="http://auto.howstuffworks.com/question399.htm">Here</a> is a good page with lots of information about diesel engines, how they work and more.</p>


	<p>According to the <span class="caps">EPA</span>'s <a href="http://www.epa.gov/otaq/models/biodsl.htm">studies in 2002</a>, when you run biodiesel three of the four major regulated pollutants drop by 50%, 50% and 80% (C02, Particulate Matter and Hydrocarbons), and NOx rises by about 10%. Note that these were done in 2002 with engines built before 1997. According to the National Biodiesel Board, <span class="caps">B100</span>'s emissions are as following: HC:67%, Carbon Monoxide:48%, Particulate Matter:47%, NOx +10%, Sulfates:100%, Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons:80%, Nitrated <span class="caps">PAH</span>:90% and Ozone potential of speciated Hydrocarbons: 50%. All of this was taken from the <a href="http://www.biodiesel.org/pdf_files/emissions.pdf">National Biodiesel Board's Research</a>.</p>


	<p>A little about biodiesel. Many of the biodiesel fuels are blends with standard diesel. This is notated as B where the number is the percent of Biodiesel that is in the mix. So, B5 is 5% biodiesel and <span class="caps">B100</span> is 100% biodiesel. Biodiesel in the US tends to be made from Soybeans.</p>


	<p>Biodiesel is also supported in existing engines - you do not need to modify the engine to run it. <a href="http://www.biodiesel.org/resources/fuelfactsheets/standards_and_warranties.shtm">The National Biodiesel Board</a> has information about specific companies and if their warranties are voided by the use of Biodiesel.</p>


	<p>In Spokane you can get biodiesel at <a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps/print.adp?mapdata=OE4WNszgW9w1%252f4HWa41NWUo6bFFkGVqyKjQNv36KWZRrBKqKpEMPpiPFucMzEWkF2eHoq4d0ZRw1N5pEe77syDot8GF67lr9HjM3airn9dNMWb4Ymk9HUqhN2dB9MK9whkwYtXIQtFHldMzXte4MzR%252f9sjpyHD%252bKHlrnwuiSi4BbjMS2b3eVoPCJlm6c2rJu6H%252brmmM5iJh25cFoXYhnTlkpDBWpv5egrAWIAwkDgeGJMUWyd%252f56%252bkMA0eUUTwXOnlLcdUNPActZqLTKJntShL3TmZy1AEchb3hJXlowsImqJ5QUY97%252fpvRVUjdWEoJDlwmjSEnDVgvJYaqcrD6qcgzxrZrejrjXF7it4TOR2S%252f%252f6Q81ehbqrYNxic%252f6ok%252fM99ZBNoqDYD2yCjeYaVO5KMKVhh%252fT4oGe3C3BnSeoLvYsjTpUuBfHkIIo8rFfjSc8Omm9GwcPdbYkD3%252bvnvYYmpDy9WfpNAfQLIpXHpJomS2tfi0sAjQxdv9k88jN%252bPbMytKJM0sRNUk%253d">City Service Valcon,18826 East Appleway, Pump 2</a>. You can find a biodiesel pump near you at (again) <a href="http://www.biodiesel.org/buyingbiodiesel/retailfuelingsites/default.shtm">The National Biodiesel Board</a>.</p>


	<p>As of this writing, Biodiesel is more expensive then normal diesel, however Congress just lowered the Excise Tax on it, and as soon as that goes into effect, it will become much more competitive.</p>


	<p>So, let's all help out Mother Nature with the tools that we have right now, and not pour billions of dollars into new infrastructure. Let's use what we have now, buy diesel and pour that vegetable oil into it!</p>

The point is that anyone can eventually find your blog if your real identity is tied to it in some way. And there may be consequences.

	<p>Can you really, honestly blog privately? I would say - No.</p>


	<p>So - here is my advice. Blog safely. Consiter that this is not a private journal. Anyone in the world can read this. They can track down your IP address, and ask your <span class="caps">ISP</span> who was using that when you posted the article. They <strong>can</strong> find you.</p>


	<p>So, post like you are having a discussuion with a freind in a public place. There are things that you would not tell some one in that context. There should be things that you would not discuss on your blog.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.ncc-1776.com/tle2005/tle307-20050220-02.html">L. Neil Smith says:</a>
<blockquote>For those uninitiated in the ways of libertarians, the acronym "ZAP" stands for "Zero Aggression Principle", a slightly different term some of us have settled on lately for what the movement has long called the "Non-Aggression Principle". What it says is that nobody has any right to initiate physical force against anybody else, for any reason.</p>


	<p>Skipping over a lot of nitpicking that goes on among libertarians about formulation and implementation, what it means is that we're not pacifists. We will fight, we just won't start it. And if everybody acted that wayâ€”not starting itâ€”about 90 percent of the world's problems, give or take the occasional volcano or tsunamiâ€”would be solved. I changed the name simply because I thought that the acronym "ZAP" was a lot more dynamic and attractive than the more traditional "NAP".</p>


	<p>One of the best and, to me, most interesting features of the Zero Aggression Principle is that so many different folks arrive at it from so many different angles. I'm not sure where it came from originally. I first read of it in Ayn Rand's essays, but later heard it explained in greater detail by Robert LeFevre. Other teachers have taught it, as well.</p>


	<p>In Independence Day, Will Smith puts it in terms his character might well have learned from his mom: "Don't start nothin', won't be nothin'!"</blockquote></p>]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[My problem with this philosophy, especially as interpreted by many Libertarians lately, is that it definately goes against the idea of defending someone else.

I think that it is moral in many cases to initiate violence against someone else if they have initiated (or in some cases threatened to initiate) violence against a third party.

In addition, a I believe in a pre-emption philosophy as well.  If there is good reason to believe that someone will initiate violence against you, you have a right to do unto them first.  For example, if someone breaks into your house you don't have to wait for them to shoot at you before you shoot them.

Obviously this all becomes seriously complex in international politics, and the ignoring (at lest in my opinion) of these complexities has really turned me off to a good portion of the libertarian proponants.

One could claim that a much earlier version of this philosophy is the 'eye for an eye' from the Old Testament.  Jesus Christ of course took this to an entirely different level with 'turn the other cheek.']]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[&quot;&lt;em&gt;My problem with this philosophy, especially as interpreted by many Libertarians lately, is that it definately goes against the idea of defending someone else.&lt;/em&gt;&quot;

I do not subscribe to that view at all. I will defend myself, my family and my community. As the threat grows larger, the response should grow larger. So, if you threaten my town, the town should orginize a defense. Today, that's called a police force. If you threaten my Country, my Country should defend it's self. Today, called the military.

If I see you attacking a third party, I should assist in de-esclating the situation however I can. However, with out a clear and present indicator of the situation - using deadly force would be difficult to rationalize.

In other words, if I were to come upon two people fighting, I would try and break it up - not shoot one of them. However, if someone came into a stuffer shack and opened fire with a AK, I feel that I would be in my right to interviene with deadly force - be it a gun, a big rock, or a good stiff taunting.

So, it really depends.

The only place that we do not agree is in preemptive violence. If some one breaks into my house, I should not shoot them dead. I should take control of the situation. If they resist, and I &lt;strong&gt; am in fear&lt;/strong&gt; for my safety, or the safety of my family, the target will go down. For example, if he breaks into my house, and I catch him, I will cover him with my gun, and call the police. If he pulls a knife, then I make the obligatory joke and shoot him.

Eye for eye is a hard one. I am really torn on that one. If some one commits a heinous crime, should they be allowed to stay in this life? That is not a choice I would want to be faced with. I used to support capital punishment. I still do in some cases - however I know that two wrongs do not make a right. I need to think on this one more.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I don't think no pre-emption is quite so simple in many cases.

I agree it is certainly best to cover the bad guy with your gun and call the police.  In many cases that would be the reasonable and expected thing to do.

If though you knew that a couple of other people had recently been shot by burglers in your neighborhood, you would be much more likely to conclude a shoot first policy is better.  This would be especially true if you were in a situation where you couldn't be sure how much of an advantage you had over this unknown intruder.  The end result might be that you kill a nonviolent kid who was just holding a screwdriver instead of the gun you thought you saw but that doesn't mean your reasoning was wrong or immoral, regretable though the result would be.

The situation would further complicate if there were no police to call or the police were corrupt (a very realistic situation if one extends this analogy into the realm of international affairs.)

There are of course other situations where this philosophy does not seem to apply.  What do you do in the case where a person is going to injure themselves?  Typically most moral codes would justify 'violence' to prevent greater harm, wresting down someone who was going to jump off a building for example.  This would of course violate the Zero Agression Principle.

Again, I think you could make useful analogies to international relations with this one.

Non-Agression is a good place to start the debate from, a decent 'default position' if you will, but I don't think it can be the be all, end all of a moral code.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[&lt;em&gt;a nonviolent kid who was just holding a screwdriver instead of the gun you thought you saw&lt;/em&gt;

If I thought that I saw a gun carried by an intruder in my house, I would feel under enough threat to use deadly force.

If I saw a intruder, and did not see a gun, I would have him in my sights and issues the clichÃ©d 'Freeze!' command. If he made a aggressive move, again deadly force would be applied. If he complied, then he would be held until reinforcements arrived. With out reinforcements, i.e. living in anarchy I would ask him how he got in, and repair the breach in my security.

Again, I do not follow non-aggression. I follow not starting aggression. If needed, I will finish it however. When called upon to finish it, I will fight unfairly, use the maximum amount of force that I physically can, and try everything in my power to insure that I win.

For example, when the World Trade was hit - the first time, I think that the response should have been more aggressive then it was. I firmly believe in the velvet glove hiding the iron fist - or the walk softly and carry a machine gun thought. We should always attempt to help with out strings attached, however if we are crossed, we should hit hard and fast.

I do not see that as preemptive. Preemption in my  mind is &quot;we think group X might do Z so we take them out&quot;. That is wrong. It should be &quot;we think group X might do Z, so we heighten our vigilance in that area - if they try it, then we take immediate and effective action.&quot;]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[If someone breaks into your house they should get what's coming to them and not be surprised at it, but my perspective is different, to say the least.  I won't bore you with the details of my choice, I'll just say that I am going to give the bad guy about 2 seconds to drop to the ground upon command, and then I'm going to 10-ring him.  Anyone who breaks into your house deserves whatever they get.  Burglary is always a felony, and there are good reasons for that.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I think that the most important part of the quote is this

&lt;em&gt;it means is that we're not pacifists. We will fight, we just won't start it. And if everybody acted that wayâ€”not starting itâ€”about 90 percent of the world's problems, give or take the occasional volcano or tsunamiâ€”would be solved.&lt;/em&gt;

This is the crux of the matter to me. Not every does, or ever will follow this, but the more people that we expose to the idea, and the more that embrace it, the better.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I would agree.

However, a truely libertarian view is not one of total pacifism. Infact, the 2000 canidate (Harry Browne) espoused killing only the leaders of 'bad' countries. Leaving the infrastructure and citizenry safe. Basically regieme changes.

He also said that he expected that targeting leaders like that would open him up to such attacks.

It's late - facts might be a wee bit off, but the gist is there. :)]]></wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=43685">WorldNetDaily: Man arrested, cuffed after using $2 bills</a></p>


<blockquote>A man trying to pay a fee using $2 bills was arrested, handcuffed and taken to jail after clerks at a Best Buy store questioned the currency's legitimacy and called police.

	<p>According to an account in the Baltimore Sun, 57-year-old Mike Bolesta was shocked to find himself taken to the Baltimore County lockup in Cockeysville, Md., where he was handcuffed to a pole for three hours while the U.S. Secret Service was called to weigh in on the case.</blockquote></p>


	<p>Wow.</p>


	<p>Now, I do not fault the Best Buy employees as much as the police in this matter. After all, it seems that the average retail employee today is decidely wet behind the ears.</p>


	<p>I used to go about asking if places honored Federal Reserve Notes. I usally was told no, or got blank looks. <em>Note: Federal Reserve Notes are any legal US Cash.</em></p>


My favorite quote:
<blockquote>Commenting on the incident, Baltimore County police spokesman Bill Toohey told the Sun: "It's a sign that we're all a little nervous in the post-9/11 world."</blockquote>

	<p>From <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/local/bal-md.olesker08mar08,1,76004.column?ctrack=1&#38;cset=true">Michael Olesker</a> at the <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/">Baltmore Sun</a></p>


	<p>Um. Yeah. Talking about blowing it way out of proportion. Let's use the terrorism card to cover up our mistakes. Some guy paying with $2 bills is going to be the next World Trade pilot. Yeah.</p>


	<p>People. Calm down a notch. Check out the situation before making a choice.</p>


	<p>"Remember, though, your best weapon is between your ears and under your scalp - provided it's loaded."</p>

<title>A big win for Free Software</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://mako.yukidoke.org/copyrighteous/ip/20050410-00.html">Mako says</a></p>


<blockquote>Greg Pomerantz pointed me to this article on a recent 2nd Circuit copyright decision. The case basically disambiguated the term "owner" in 17 U.S.C. Â§117 (a). It may seem nit-picky and obscure but (AFAICT, <span class="caps">IANAL</span>, OMG) this decision has good implications for free software hackers.</blockquote>

	<p>and</p>


<blockquote>The case in question is Krause v. Titleserv Inc., 03-9303. Here is the back story: William Krause was a programmer and consultant hired by Titleserv to write a series of programs over the course of a decade. When Krause left Titleserv, he left the company the right use the software but not modify it. Using technical means that are not entirely clear from what I've read, he left the software "locked" so that the company did not have access to source code or the ability to modify the program. Evidently, the technical means were not very good ones. Titleserv managed to sidestep these restrictions and bring the software back into modifiable source form. They modified the program to keep it working a number of times and in a number of sometimes rather intrusive ways.

	<p>Second Circuit Judges Pierre Leval and Robert Katzmann sided with Titleserv. Leval said that courts should, "inquire into whether the party exercises sufficient incidents of ownership over a copy of the program to be sensibly considered the owner of the copy for purposes of Â§117(a)." Rightful possession is ownership.</blockquote></p>


	<p>Seems like a landmark case. If you have rightful possession of a program - then you own it and can freely modify it. This is huge!</p>


<blockquote>If you're really interested, here is another <a href="http://www.nixonpeabody.com/copyright_article.asp?ID=55&#38;PubType=A">article</a> and you can find the full case on Lexis and elsewhere.</blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[It is pretty obvious that if the 'owner' was the copywrite owner, not the owner of a copy this provision would be meaningless.  Generally speaking, a copywrite owner is free to make any modification he wants to a copy he owns.

However, I don't think this case has nearly as broad of an implication as they think it has.  First, I would bet that some of the lattitude given in the modifications was that this was a custom developed program for the company and not generally commercially availible.  In any copywrite dispute those factors would weigh heavily.

Second, even if this was allowed as precident for modifications to 'owned' code, I would expect it would not provide any protection for supplying code to others people for modification to their own 'owned' code (let alone unowned code.)]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I think that the big deal is that the owner of the software - not the copyright holder - was able to modify the software to better suit their needs.

This would be like someone reverse engineering and re-writing portions of Windows for their corprate use. This opens the door for a lot of things..

&quot;Mr Anderson - I see that you are using the Matrix 3.7 Printer Driver. It has been modifed to work under Linux. This is a breach of my copyright...Um...oh.. You own a Matrix 3.7 Printer. Sorry - you have the right to use a modified version. So sorry. I will just go and kill some hackers now.&quot;

Basically - this is starting to limit the onerous licenese that certain companys (from Redmond for example) force people to agree to before you can use their software.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I don't disagree that the outcome you describe would be a good thing, I just don't think this case gets us very close to that.

Basically, the fact that the program in question was developed specifically for Titleserv seems to play a big part in this case.  I don't think this will have any effect on mass market software.]]></wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>A once secret plan to build a nuclear landmine 'run' by live chickens has gone on public display for the first time at The National Archives, Kew, as part of the acclaimed Secret State Exhibition.</blockquote>

	<p>You can read the rest <a href="http://improbable.typepad.com/improbable_research_whats/2005/04/nuclear_pullet_.html">here</a>, but it boils down to this. They were going to stuff a nuclear landmine full of chickens to insure that the weapon's important parts did not get too cold and freeze up during the winter.</p>


	<p>Leave it to the human race to come up with an idea this unique.</p>


	<p>I don't know if I am amazed by our resourcefullness or sickened.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://davejustus.blogspot.com/2005/04/calm-before-storm.html">Dave</a> sez:</p>


<blockquote>In short, the more the Jihadists lose in Iraq, the more likely they are to use their rump forces to try something really crazy in America to make up for it. So let's stay the course in Iraq, but stay extra-vigilant at home.Certainly something worth thinking about. There is endless speculation into the mindset and motivations of Al-Qaida types. Some of what they do seems to make sense, other things seem to be extremely bizarre</blockquote>

	<p>I think that this almost goes with out saying. As a caged or cornered animal, I expect them to fight harder. I expect attempts at acts larger then the World Trade.</p>


	<p>The best way to keep this from happening is to keep them off balance as well as tightening security at home. If they are denied a base of operations, training areas, and the other infrastructure that it takes to run an organization that large, they will be pretty ineffective.</p>


	<p>I think that is what Bush is betting on. Keep hitting them hard - with conventional as well as unconventional forces, keep them running, and they will not have the time or energy to mount an effective attack.</p>


	<p>Long term, I do not think this will be an effective tactic. I feel that we need to start to look at the situation in a more strategic light. We need to identify the why of the matter. Why are these people so angry at us? It's not enough to say that it's just crazy people, or it's their religion - that is patently not true. There are underlying reasons - some caused by our foreign policy over the last 50 years, some caused by where these people live.</p>


	<p>To really end terrorism as it exists today, we need to fix the underlying problems. That is a very long term effort, and it's going to be a hard row to hoe. It will take a lot of introspection on our part, and apologizing for our missteps in the past. It will also take our engendering and promoting a culture of tolerance and openness.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I agree.

My belief is that if their is a single root cause of terrorism it is lack of freedom in the Arab world.  Lack of Freedom slows development, puts a ceiling on the middle class (the big recruitment ground for terrorists), makes it had to adapt to changes (globalization), and is also directly a source of propaganda as thugish regimes are forces to point the fingers elsewhere (U.S. and Israel) for their problems.

The real problem is though, even Freedom isn't a quick fix.  A lot of the things freedom will provide may take close to a generation to seep through the culture, ideology, and economic well being of the populous.

I think apologizing where it is warrented is good, but we have been equally shitty to other regions of the world and they have't spawned large terrorist movements.  The root cause isn't us.  I don't believe it is a coincidence that the least free region on earth is also the home to the most terrorists.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I think that the problems are caused by a juxtaposition of unfortunate root issues. One, certainly is our foreign policy in the area, as well as the success of our culture. Another is the wealth of the area being so great, and in the hands of so few. We can also look to the fundamentalism that pushes them on.

Any one of these stressors would not be enough to create the cesspool of violence, but when put together, the sum is greater then the parts.

We need to take ownership of our hand in the matter, where it makes sense.]]></wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What are the root causes of terrorism, and what can we do about them?</p>


	<p>In an earlier article, I spoke a little about the root causes of Terrorism. I mentioned our foreign policy over the last 50 years , and I still feel that is part of the issue. However, writing about this made me want to find out what the real 'root causes' of terrorism are.</p>


	<p>This is what I have found so far:</p>


<blockquote>Those who hold to 'poverty as the root causeâ€ do so even though the data does not fit their model. Even leaving aside multimillionaire Osama bin Laden, the backgrounds of the September 11 killers indicates that they were without exception scions of privilege: all were either affluent Saudis and Egyptians, citizens of the wealthy Gulf statelets, or rich sons of Lebanon, trained in and familiar with the ways of the West â€” not exactly the victims of poverty in Muslim dictatorships.</blockquote>

	<p>From <a href="http://www.fpri.org/about/people/radu.html">Dr. Radu's</a> <a href="http://www.fpri.org/enotes/americawar.20020423.radu.futilesearchforrootcauses.html">article</a> The Futile Search for 'Root Causesâ€ of Terrorism</p>


	<p>That makes sense. They need people who can move unnoticed through our society. People who were educated at our schools and speak our language very well. You will not find that amongst the poor in most countries.</p>


<blockquote>Most terrorists are not motivated by the prospect of financial gain or the hopelessness of poverty, says economist Alan B. Krueger, least of all in the Middle East.
Only 13 percent of Palestinian suicide bombers are from impoverished families, while about a third of the Palestinian population is in poverty, according to new research by Claude Berrebi, a Princeton University graduate student.
A remarkable 57 percent of suicide bombers have some education beyond high school, compared with just 15 percent of the population of comparable age.
This evidence corroborates findings for other Middle Eastern and Latin American terrorist groups. Terrorists are drawn from society's elites, not the dispossessed. </blockquote>

	<p>From <a href="http://www.ncpa.org/iss/ter/2003/pd053003c.html">The Motivation for Terrorism</a>, by <a href="http://www.ncpa.org">National Center for Policy Analysis</a></p>


	<p>One of the things that I have often felt, is that Terrorism targeted at us is related to how we are perceived on the on the global stage. Over the last 50 years, we have been, if not the most, one of the most powerful players in the world. How have we used this power?</p>


<blockquote>According to the Pentagon's Defense Science Board, a strong correlation exists between U.S. involvement in international situations and an increase in terrorist attacks against the United States. President Clinton has also acknowledged that link. The board, however, has provided no empirical data to support its conclusion. This paper fills that gap by citing many examples of terrorist attacks on the United States in retaliation for U.S. intervention overseas. The numerous incidents cataloged suggest that the United States could reduce the chances of such devastating-<del>and potentially catastrophic</del>-terrorist attacks by adopting a policy of military restraint overseas.</blockquote>

	<p>From the <a href="http://www.cato.org/index.html">Cato Institutes's</a> Article <a href="http://www.cato.org/pubs/fpbriefs/fpb-050es.html">Does U.S. Intervention Overseas Breed Terrorism? The Historical Record</a></p>


	<p>But, what kind of policy's are we talking about?</p>


<blockquote>The U.S., having decided that an Iranian victory would not serve its interests, began supporting Iraq: measures already underway to upgrade U.S.-Iraq relations were accelerated, high-level officials exchanged visits, and in February 1982 the State Department removed Iraq from its list of states supporting international terrorism.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Iraq received massive external financial support from the Gulf states, and assistance through loan programs from the U.S. The White House and State Department pressured the Export-Import Bank to provide Iraq with financing, to enhance its credit standing and enable it to obtain loans from other international financial institutions. The U.S. Agriculture Department provided taxpayer-guaranteed loans for purchases of American commodities, to the satisfaction of U.S. grain exporters.</blockquote>

	<p>From <a href="http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/special/iraq/">The Saddam Hussein Sourcebook</a></p>


	<p>So , we propped up Saddam, gave him money and material to fight a war, and now we don't understand why the people that he brutalized dislike us? There are more and more examples of this kind of duplicity on our parts. We helped the Taliban fight the Russians, and then we get angry when they continue with their same extremist ways. We help with one hand, and strike with the other. It makes no sense.</p>


	<p>I certainly hope that our Foreign policymakers see the problems that our history has caused, and take a more open, and constructive approach in the future. We should be helping people be free, happy and safe , not funding extremists and butchers. We should be leading this world by example , not by a leash.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Certainly the fact that the terrorists are middle class shouldn't surprise anyone with any grasp of history at all.  Revolutions are always precipitated by the middle class, usually in response to hitting a 'glass ceiling' where they can rise no higher.  The poor are generally too busy surviving and lack resources to ferment a serious revolution anyway.

This bit, from the National Center for Policy Analysis you posted on is, I think the most signifigant peice of information on this question:

&quot;    * No other factor besides a lack of civil liberties -- including the literacy rate, infant mortality rate, terrain, ethnic divisions and religious fractionalization -- could predict whether people from that country were more or less likely to take part in international terrorism.

Thus economically well off countries that lack civil liberties have spawned relatively many terrorists. Poor countries with a tradition of protecting civil liberties are unlikely to spawn terrorists.&quot;

The Cato Institute paper strikes me as particularly unconvincing.  I think that it explains pretexts for an attack, but not reasons why the people became terrorists or what truly motivates them.  In addition, it treats domestic terrorist attacks and terrorist attacks fully sponsorer by foreign governments the same as Al-Qaida style terrorist groups.  Several of it's examples (the Japanese Cult plans to attack Disneyland is a biggie) seem to be a stretch to link things with our foreign policy actions.

It seems to me that they already had their answer, and then went hunting for data to support it.  That doesn't really tell us anything, except what sort of foreign policy the Cato Institute favors.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Just looking at Osama's history, the causes that he has assisted shows that it's not our culture, it's not a case of the have-nots vs the haves. It's a case of anger directly because of the heavy handed involvement that U.S. Foreign policy has become since the Cold War.

Lebanon is a perfect example.

&lt;em&gt;On May 17, 1983, an agreement was signed by the representatives of Lebanon, Israel, and the United States that provided for Israeli withdrawal. Syria declined to discuss the withdrawal of its troops, effectively stalemating further progress. Opposition to the negotiations and to U.S. support for the Gemayel regime led to a series of terrorist attacks in 1983 and 1984 on U.S. interests&lt;/em&gt;  (from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ghazi.de/history.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Lebanon's History&lt;/a&gt;)

If true or not, a lot of the perception is that the U.S. is a bully. Let's look at our actions in a different arena.

Imagine that you are a teacher, and you just moved to a new school. You hear that there are several groups of 4th and 5th graders that fight at lunchtime. Would you fight with one of the smaller groups?

That is what we have been doing in the past. We, the biggest power on the block, have been picking sides and fighting for what we 'think is right' ignoring social and cultural contexts that we simply do not understand as westerners.

Instead of promoting peaceful discourse, we have been selling weapons. Instead of trying to understand what is going on, we have been picking sides.

And we are amazed when people are angry with us?

I agree totally that peaceful societies will not breed terrorists - but how we reach that place is as important as getting there.

I support the war in Iraq - we put Saddam into power, and he was killing people right and left. We needed to clean up our mess. Other then that, we need to allow those people to work out their own problems. We need to give them support and help - not guns.]]></wp:comment_content>
