<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family:arial;">I guess that this is the day to take political tests... </span></p><p>
<span style="font-family:arial;">The thing to be aware of (as I am sure that you are) is that the questions tend to corral you into the responses that the askers want.

	<p></span><span style="font-family:arial;">Just remember - </span><a href="http://www.sjgames.com/pentabarf"><span style="font-family:arial;">Semper Discordia</span></a><span style="font-family:arial;">!
</span></p><p><span style="font-family:arial;">Took the </span><a href="http://www.theadvocates.org/quiz.html"><span style="font-family:arial;">Worlds Smallest Political Quiz</span></a><span style="font-family:arial;">
</span></p><p><span style="font-family:arial;">The <b><span style="COLOR: rgb(255,0,0)">red dot</span></b> on the Chart shows where I fit on the political map.</span></p><p><span style="font-family:arial;"><img height="352" src="http://www.theadvocates.org/quiz/draw.php?p=10&amp;e=10" width="351" usemap="#quizmap" border="0" /> <map name="quizmap"><area shape="POLY" coords="175,0,263,88,223,127,127,127,88,88" href="http://www.theadvocates.org/quiz/quiz.php#libertarian"></area><area shape="POLY" coords="0,175,88,88,127,127,127,223,88,263" href="http://www.theadvocates.org/quiz/quiz.php#liberal"></area><area shape="POLY" coords="350,175,263,263,223,223,223,127,263,88" href="http://www.theadvocates.org/quiz/quiz.php#conservative"></area><area shape="POLY" coords="175,350,263,263,223,223,127,223,88,263" href="http://www.theadvocates.org/quiz/quiz.php#authoritarian"></area><area shape="RECT" coords="127,127,223,223" href="http://www.theadvocates.org/quiz/quiz.php#centrist"></area></map></p>


	<p></span></p><p><span style="font-family:arial;">Just found </span><a href="http://www.votingcatholic.org/quiz_1.php?session_id=1322300527"><span style="font-family:arial;">this political test</span></a><span style="font-family:arial;">.. It scored me vs the Catholic Bishops, Bush and Kerry. The higher percentage equates to more agreement on this issue.</p>


	<p>Here is my score:</p>


	<p>Overall
Bishops -18%
Bush 9%
Kerry -27%</p>


	<p>Protecting Human Life
Bishops -25%
Bush -25%
Kerry 50%</p>


	<p>Promoting Family Life
Bishops -100%
Bush -100%
Kerry -100%</p>


	<p>Pursuing Social Justice
Bishops 0%
Bush 45%
Kerry -70%</p>


	<p>Pursuing Global Solidarity
Bishops 0%
Bush 100%
Kerry -50%</p>


Wow. Some of those questions and category's are really... um... biased. But what did I expect? Everyone has their axe to grind. </span></p><p><span style="font-family:arial;">-Tsyko</span></p><p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the years, I have been less then perfect about keeping up with people. I am very <em>now</em> oriented, and seem to have a hard time remembering to keep in touch with friends and family from long ago or far away.</p>


	<p>I have never liked this about my self, and have often wished that I could do something about it. I have tried several times, setting up mailing lists and other thing-a-ma-jiggers, however for whatever reason, they never flew.</p>


	<p>So, here is my spot in cyberspace. Ya'll can drop on by and check up on me when ever you want. Please feel free to comment on things that I say. I crave feedback.</p>


	<p>On April 17th, 2004 I married Shela. I made a slide show of some of the digital pictures from before, during and after the wedding. You can view it <a href=http://www.nwgamers.org/wedding.asf>here!</a>. Some of the family has already seen it, but here it is in all of its glory for all of you.</p>


	<p>Quite honestly, Shela and I met during the end of a very dark time in my life. I had just ended a 10-year relationship and marriage on less then friendly terms, and was also reeling from a very hard breakup with some one that was very close to me. She was not ready for a committed relationship, but then again neither was I. I really hope that all of my ex's can find real, deep happiness. That is all that I have really ever wanted for them and me. I think that I have gotten there now and I hope that their journeys there are as swift as possible.</p>


	<p>Shela was like a ray of sunlight at the end of a long tunnel. When I met her, my whole life was starting on an upswing, and she helped me out so much. Her bubbly personality was, and is, just what I need. She also is just as stubborn as I am. We butt heads every once in a while, but that is just part of life. We are both strong personalities, and quite honestly, I would not have it any other way.</p>


	<p>Just about 11 weeks ago, Shela and I made a little Shela and Dukk. Now, a lot of you know me from my 'No Kids, Never No How' phase. Gladly (since one is on the way) I am actually looking forward to this. I think that it is going to be a rewarding experience.</p>


	<p>The pregnancy has been hard on Shela so far, she was on an IV at home for about 3 weeks. Happily, she is back at work now, and glad to be off the couch!</p>

<title>Politics, Media and Personal Safety</title>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The really great thing about living in the US is that we are allowed to have divergent opinions about the political scene. This can give rise to the worst and the best of humanity. I think that this election season has exemplified each of these traits.</p>


	<p>The Barend vs. Kuhl campaign has really shown us the dark underside of political campaigning. It seems that Kuhl was divorced several years ago. This all is happening in New York and under New York law, the records of that are sealed for 100 years to prevent just what is happening.</p>


	<p>Some one went to the Steuben County clerk's office, and asked for the records, claiming to be working on a school project. They were then leaked to the press.</p>


	<p>Now, to the crux of the issue in my mind, the press then decided that this was newsworthy, and started to do story after story about this private matter. Who is to blame? The media for one.</p>


	<p>It seems that they have become untouchable in the past few years. They can say whatever they want, ignore facts that do not jive with their view of the world, and accentuate the parts of a story that further their agenda.</p>


	<p>I do not watch the news anymore. The news is simply scare tactics. All that they want to do is show every bad thing that has happened to people in the past day.</p>


	<p>You know, I am sorry, but I do not really care if a person was murdered by their ex-spouse in littlesburg, anystate. The amount of reporting about crime makes us think that we live in a society that is breaking down, that is totally unsafe.</p>


	<p>This is totally not true.</p>


	<p>According to the <a href="http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/cvictgen.htm"><span class="caps">US DOJ</span></a> there were about 24 million crimes last year.</p>


	<p>Violent victimization and property crime rates in 2001 were the lowest recorded since the <span class="caps">NCVS</span>' inception in 1973. There were about 24 million crimes in 2001.</p>


	<p>According to the US Census, we have about 294,500,000 people right now. You have a 1 in 10 chance of having <span class="caps">ANY</span> crime committed against you, and only 22% of those are violent crimes. So, in 2004 your chances of having a violent crime committed against you were only 1.8% - less then 1 in 50. In 2003 for every 1,000 persons age 12 or older, there occurred 1 rape or sexual assault, 1 assault with injury, and 2 robberies. In 2002 there were only about 6 murder victims per 100,000.</p>


	<p>If we are to believe the media, we live in a period of time that is one of the most unsafe ever. What does that make the 70's, when crime was much higher? We must have been living in a war zone!</p>


	<p>News media lies. It's that simple. Never believe them, as they have stopped being objective and started to report only what they want, to further their agenda. Check out alternate news sources (<a href="http://news.google.com">Google News</a> and <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk">The <span class="caps">BBC</span></a> are two of my favorites) and check the facts.</p>


	<p>Never trust the media.</p>


	<p>Kill your television.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I believe that Tolken meant for his books to be an allegory for life. Many of the darkest portions were written while he served in World War One. His books paint a picture that is very much black and white. We have the soul-wrenching evil of Sauron and the lily-white purity of the Elves and Gandalf.</p>


	<p>Or do we? The real world is all shades of grey, and I believe that he showed us a world where under the surface; all was not as black and white as we would be lead to think. For example, the Elves created the problem (Sauron) and were up and leaving. Gandalf never revealed his true intentions, nor that he more then likely saw what was coming. If he had been up front with the 'forces of good' about what they were going to face, would any of them even left their hearths and homes and ventured out?</p>


	<p>Right now, we face a foe just as determined as Sauron was in the books. Instead of marshaling armies, however, he strikes at our culture, our hearts and minds. Do not mistake his aims; his goal is to remake the world into his image. It would be easier to accept if he invaded countries, marched on cities and waged a conventional war, however he knows that he cannot openly fight us and win.</p>


	<p>The Era of the conventional war is slipping away. No one in the world can stand up to the <span class="caps">USA</span> in a conventional slugging match, and the entire world sees this. Other tactics must be used if these people want to wage war on us and have a chance of winning. The tactics of Terror are the manual for the new war. In essence, our strength has caused the New War.</p>


	<p>Unlikely warriors fight many of the battles outside of the public eye. It can be as simple as extending a truly non-judgmental helping hand to some one in need, or as complex as a Special Forces strike on a safe house to remove the threat of an attack. People are fighting and dying right now to keep you and me safe, and we will never know their names, never even know of the conflict that is happening as we tuck each other into bed at night.</p>


	<p>Mistake me not; this war is going on right now, all over the world, in the shadows. If we are to win it, we must fight with resolve. When force is called for, we must strike hard and fast and never waver. When other options are available to us, we must use them.</p>

<title>Spokane Catholic Diocese declares bankruptcy</title>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yes, you heard it right. Following the precedent set by 2 other Dioceses around the country, the Spokane Catholics have decided that they simply cannot afford to fight all of the allegations against them in court. So, they will chapter 11 and dodge the bullet.</p>


	<p>There are 28 lawsuits right now against the Spokane Diocese, and about 130 claimants. Two priests who worked for the diocese over 30 years ago accounted for about half of those claims. All of these are sexual abuse claims.</p>


	<p>The issue here is not that a priest made a mistake. After all, priests are just men who can make mistakes, and should be held responsible for those mistakes like every one else. The root issue is how the Church handed the issues.</p>


<blockquote>'...drawing attention to Skylstad's relationship with Patrick G. O'Donnell Jr., one of Spokane's most notorious priests. Forced from ministry in the 1980s, O'Donnell abused, by his own admission, at least 30 boys. That admission came out in a recent set of depositions taken as part of the lawsuits, and which were first reported by the Spokesman-Review and Seattle Times. O'Donnell's testimony has provided critics like <span class="caps">SNAP</span> with more information, which, they believe, suggests that Skylstad failed to intervene when he had the chance more than 20 years ago.</blockquote>

	<p>from <a href="http://www.inlander.com/localnews/285553968869587.php">the Inlander</a></p>


	<p>In every instance, there has been evidence of conspiracy, collusion and cover ups by the Church. If a private company, say a daycare, had these allegations raised, no one would raise a stink about lawsuits nor give them any special treatment. However, since this is Religion, here we go.</p>


	<p>To dig down to the essence of the issue, Power corrupts. When ever a 'universal truth' is espoused, this gives the espouser's a lot of moral leeway. After all, they are the 'one true way' and everyone else is wrong.</p>


	<p>We can see evidence of this in the history of the Church. Look at how they treated indigenous peoples and religions. In Wales, it was a crime to teach Welsh. Over 5 million women were burned at the stake, with the blessing of the church, because they were suspected to be witches. The Church even published, or at least blessed (the reports differ on that), a book "<a href="http://www.malleusmaleficarum.org/">The Malleus Maleficarum</a>", that detailed how to torture "<span style="font-style: italic;">witches</span>" into confessing their heresy. Often the "<span style="font-style: italic;">witches</span>" were just women that offended the local priest or headman. Also, how many people were tortured and killed by the Inquisition for any number of things , including not agreeing with the Inquisition on religious matters?</p>


	<p>For example, did you know that a Council of bishops declared that Jesus was divine? (Council of Nicea, 325 AD - <a href="http://www.gospelcom.net/chi/GLIMPSEF/Glimpses/glmps088.shtml">here</a> and <a href="http://reslight.addr.com/item0007.html">here</a>. Many more resources are available on the net , use <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a>). All over the place, we have Men declaring Their truth is The Only Truth and killing those that oppose them.</p>


	<p>What about the bible? Is is inspired by god or just a convenient fiction? I do not know, but this is fact , large parts of the bible that did not agree with the Church's views were tossed right out. <a href="http://www.scborromeo.org/truth/fig4.htm">Here</a> is a partial list of the books that they had. Many are still available, and the Anglican Church still uses many of them in their services. Here is a good discussion on forms of <a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/chr_hcri.htm">criticism of the bible</a>, it's tactics and the arguments used by Christians to defend it.</p>


	<p>I will never stand in the way of someone who wants to believe a certain way - I simply hold that they should extend me the same right. I also firmly believe that people and organizations should be held responsible for their actions, under the law of the land. To believe that we are 'above' or 'better' then the law of the land is inviting disaster. In my most humble opinion, the most important law is - <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">do no harm</span>.</p>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The day after yesterday I saw a pretty good movie called <a href="http://www.thedayaftertomorrow.com/">The Day After Tomorrow</a>. In it there is a lot of heroism and stuff , but what I really grokked was the science.</p>


	<p>The basic story was that the climate shifts suddenly, and a lot of scientists say 'I told you so!'</p>


	<p>Now, I do not think that these things could happen over 3 days like in the movie , but there is mounting evidence that such things could happen over several years. You seem it all comes down to something called '<a href="http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2004/05mar_arctic.htm">the Atlantic Conveyor</a>' which is a current that pumps warm water up north, and takes cold water down south.</p>


	<p>There is <a href="http://www.esd.ornl.gov/projects/qen/transit.html">historical evidence</a> that the last ice age (between 10,000 and 20,000 years ago) was sudden in onset. Sudden, meaning with in a <a href="http://www.whoi.edu/institutes/occi/currenttopics/climatechange_wef.html">decade</a>. Could you imagine the northern reaches of the United States and all of Canada being pushed under a sheet of ice in the next six years?</p>


	<p>All of this is being caused by <a href="http://calspace.ucsd.edu/virtualmuseum/climatechange1/cc1syllabus.shtml">global warming</a> , funnily enough. As the worldwide mean temperature rises, more ice melts off of the ice caps. This lowers the salt content of the Oceans, which causes the conveyors to stop functioning, which causes the temperatures to drop dramatically closer to the poles and raise closer to the equator.</p>


	<p>This is such a serious thing, that the <a href="http://ipsnews.net/interna.asp?idnews=22410">Pentagon</a> has funded <a href="http://www.fortune.com/fortune/technology/articles/0,15114,582584-3,00.html">studies</a> into it, fearing what such climatological shifts could do to world stability. As much of the food production changes from the locations that we are used to to new places (as the current breadbaskets will be under sheets of ice or deserts) the geopolitical landscape could radically change.</p>


	<p>Wars fought over rapidly vanishing farmlands, massive migrations of people away from the desert that they used to call home, it all sounds like a science fiction story.</p>


	<p>What can we do today to help? I have heard the climate called 'a big ship' in that, once it starts to move in a direction, it can be hard to change it's course. However, everyone of us can help. Stop using wasteful vehicles , switch to cleaner hybrids or bio diesel driven cars and trucks. Lower that thermostat in your house , even if you use electricity, it might be coming from coal fired plants. Walk, or ride a bike instead of driving. Recycle. The mantra of the Greens. It's not hard, it is just sad that the current marketplace makes it so expensive to do these things.</p>


	<p>The one thing that we can do is stop eating hamburgers. You think I am kidding? <a href="http://www.cgfi.org/materials/articles/2005/april_01_05.htm">Cows</a> produce a lot of green house gases!</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote> 'I am not a logician. I am an existentialist. I believe in this meaningless, beautiful chaos of existence, and I am ready to go with it wherever it leads. I don't have a goal, because existence has no goal. It simply is, flowering, blossoming, dancing - but don't ask why. Just an overflow of energy, for no reason at all. I am with existence."  Osho</blockquote>

I also identify with Discordism, and this passage neatly intertwines Buddhism, Zen and Discord. No Mind - existing at the whim of the present merges neatly with Discordism
<blockquote><center>
GP: Is Eris true?
M2: Everything is true.
GP: Even false things?
M2: Even false things are true.
GP: How can that be?
M2: I don't know man, I didn't do it.</center></blockquote>

	<p>Why are we so concerned with Why we are here? If we found out, would it really change that much? Why not just live each day the best we can, and die with peace? And, honestly, does the universe really make that much sense?</p>


	<p>Every time we dig deeper with Physics, or String Theory, we find another layer of complexity. It's like the universe is an Onion with layer after layer of tear inspiring complexity. Will we really ever get to the bottom of the rabbit hole? Do we want to?</p>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Everything is under the great paradox. To balance within the walls of the paradox is the goal. It is like a game, hence all the games afoot.
Even the Elohim [whom claim to be our creators] love the violent games. I told them, how immature to keep repeating the same game over and over...

Anyway, the paradox is a triangle. The one wall is the great life screen which we live it all out on. The side walls both go down to a single point, no fourth wall. The point or connecting of the two walls has nothing. Where does the images on the screen wall come from?

The two walls represent good and evil, anything like this applies.
We live in a triangle, no floor or ceiling, just pretend you see one. Yet we're trapped till a higher authority comes for us.
One came for me, yet I don't die yet.
Soon perhaps.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In my net reading for the last article I posted, I came across a site that I kind of liked. The person behind the site has several books out, and I plan on getting a few of them. I lifted some quotes from his site that impacted me the most, and decided to put them here for ya'll with my commentary over the next few days.</p>


<blockquote>"I have no wish to placate you with false, hollow and worthless words exhorting you to love mankind. The so-called religions have said these things to you for generations. I am here to urge you to love real men, to love your fellow beings - not mankind but the men who live and work around you. Humanity is just a word; mankind is just a label. You cannot find humanity or mankind anywhere. And so humanity is easy to love because the only thing you have to do is mouth a few platitudes." - Osho</blockquote>

	<p>I have a book called Everyday Zen. One of the passages talks about tooth-brushing. If, when you were 4 or 5 and starting to brush your teeth, you dwelled on how you would have to do this every day for the rest of your life, you might not have ever started. However, I doubt that you did. Instead, you simply did it today. Habits are easy to form if you just do the action today.</p>


	<p>Most major changes seem large, if you look at the entire thing. Sort of like painting an elephant. Over all, it is an overwhelming task. But, if you get close, and look at just the trunk, and decide to paint it, it would not take all that long. and the same with the legs, sides and back. Sooner then not, you are looking at a pink elephant.</p>


	<p>The same thing with Love. Do not aspire to love all of humanity. just aspire to love the people that you meet through out the day. The Dali Lama spoke about thinking "I Love You" you every person that you meet through out the day. He said that puts you in the correct frame of mind, and that the person can tell through your body language and expression what you are thinking. This puts them at ease and makes true communication possible.</p>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><center>So whatcha doin' tonight?<br />
Have you heard that the world's gone crazy? <br />
Young Americans listen when I say there's people puttin' us down<br />
I know they're sayin' that we've gone lazy<br />
To tell you the truth we've all seen better days<br />
Don't need no fast buck lame duck profits for fun<br />
Quick trick plans, take the money and run<br />
We need long term, slow burn, getting it done<br />
And some straight talking, hard working son of a gun.<br />
Whatcha doin' tonight, I got faith in our generation<br />
Let's stick together and futurize our attitudes<br />
I ain't lookin' to fight, but I know with determination<br />
We can challenge the schemers who cheat all the rules<br />
Come on take pride, be wise, spottin' the fools<br />
No more big shots, crackpots bending the rules<br />
A fair shot here for me and for you<br />
Knowing that we can't lose<br />
<em>Styx Rocking the Paradise</em></center></blockquote>

<p>I think that these words ring as true today as they did in 1981 when the album was released. Except, now the people puttin' us down are also blowing us up and have declared war, not on us, but on our way of life.</p>

<p>The enemy does not want to take some of our land, they want to see all of us dead. They want our way of life dead. They want to strangle Ronald McDonald in the street, and behead Jack (of Jack in the Box) in front of a video camera. They want to control what music we listen to, what we wear and how we worship.</p>

<p>Now, as a Buddhist, I am supposed to be against killing. And I am in most cases. However, I feel that defense of my family's life, of my freedom and of the freedom of my country people is a worthy cause. I salute the men and women that are on the front lines , giving up their holiday time with their family's to defend us, and to help another people realize the freedom that we all deserve.</p>

<p>As a people, we must approach the rest of the world with compassion, and a iron fist in a velvet glove. When we need to hit, it must be hard, precise and with out remorse. However, when the iron fist is not the answer, we have to start actually helping the rest of the world. We cannot continue our ways of funding extremists who happen to be fighting our enemy at the time. If there is a famine, we need to assist as the richest country in the world can. We need stop propping up governments and companies, and start dealing with the problems at home. We need to behave less like codependent parents and more like a good friend.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://davejustus.blogspot.com/2004/12/email-controversy.html">Dave Justus</a> says in re an article at <a href="http://www.forbes.com/technology/ebusiness/feeds/ap/2004/12/22/ap1725617.html">Forbes</a>:</p>


<blockquote>Yahoo! is standing by its policy of protecting the privacy of its e-mail subscribers, spokeswoman Karen Mahon said. This is an interesting dilemma. Should an email account and the electronic documents it contains be considered part of an estate, to be transferred to the heirs of a person after death or should it remain private? Typically I believe traditional letters would become the property of the heirs but one could argue, as I guess Yahoo! is doing, that email accounts do not automatically transfer.
</blockquote>
I think that in this increasingly digital age, this is going to become more of a problem. I know that if I were to die today, there are three sites that would die as well, as my brain is the only place the passwords are kept.

	<p>Passwords and accounts need to be willed. One should leave specific instructions on how to handle all of ones affairs - and now days that includes Blogs, Websites, email accounts, Pay Pal accounts, Ebay - the list goes on and on.</p>


	<p>I side with Yahoo! on this one - unless there are specific instructions in the Will of the person that gives his or her heirs the rights to access the accounts. There could be information in the email that perhaps he did not want people to read. We do not know. With out more specific instructions from the deceased, I feel that we should not impinge upon his privacy.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Why can't we have the Christmas Spirit all year?</p>


	<p>Not the one where angry housewives beat each other up to obtain the newest stuffed toy, or fustrated drivers try and kill each other while exiting the malls of America. I am talking about gathering around the family, enjoying them. Forget the presents, the Egg Nog, and Xeroxing your butt at the company party.</p>


	<p>This season is not about making some shopkeeper's books balance. It's about seeing loved ones. It's about celebrating the days starting to get longer. Of all the years and all the Holiday seasons that I have lived through - here is a list of the best memories that I have:</p>


	<p>Making turkey stuffing with my Dad</p>


	<p>Visiting my Aunt in LA - Several times</p>


	<p>Seeing my Granny in Oregon</p>


	<p>Playing Jenga at another Aunts house</p>


	<p>When I got my Porche from Santa.</p>


	<p>Just kidding about the last one.</p>


	<p>We should try and focus on the good times, good freinds and family. The Corps have pushed and advertised us and coaxed us into thinking that the season is about how much you can buy, how much more useless crap you can stuff into you life. If you are not spending a ton of money on those that you love, then you must really not love them, right?</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>First off, we need to be all reading from the same page, so here are some definitions:<br /><br />Free software is <a href=http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html>defined</a> as:<br /><br /><i>* The freedom to run the program, for any purpose (freedom 0). <br /><br />* The freedom to study how the program works, and adapt it to your needs (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this. <br /><br />* The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor (freedom 2). <br /><br />* The freedom to improve the program, and release your improvements to the public, so that the whole community benefits (freedom 3). Access to the source code is a precondition for this. </i><br /><br />Open Source Software is <a href=http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php>defined</a> as:<br /><br /><i>* The license shall not restrict any party from selling or giving away the software as a component of an aggregate software distribution containing programs from several different sources. The license shall not require a royalty or other fee for such sale.<br />The program must include source code, and must allow distribution in source code as well as compiled form.<br /><br />* The license must allow modifications and derived works, and must allow them to be distributed under the same terms as the license of the original software.<br /><br />* The license may restrict source-code from being distributed in modified form only if the license allows the distribution of "patch files" with the source code for the purpose of modifying the program at build time.<br /><br />* The license must not discriminate against any person or group of persons.<br /><br />* The license must not restrict anyone from making use of the program in a specific field of endeavor. For example, it may not restrict the program from being used in a business, or from being used for genetic research.<br /><br />* The rights attached to the program must apply to all to whom the program is redistributed without the need for execution of an additional license by those parties.<br /><br />* The rights attached to the program must not depend on the program's being part of a particular software distribution. <br /><br />* The license must not place restrictions on other software that is distributed along with the licensed software. For example, the license must not insist that all other programs distributed on the same medium must be open-source software.<br /><br />* No provision of the license may be predicated on any individual technology or style of interface.</i><br /><br />Now that we have the definitions out of the way, we can continue on and discuss the rationale behind these movements, and what they bring to the table in our real world. The two terms seem very similar, in fact the only difference is that you can sell open source software, and free software is, well, free.<br /><br /><span class="caps">OSS</span> (Open Source Software) and <span class="caps">FOSS</span> (Free/Open Source Software) are on a track to merge. The <span class="caps">FOSS</span> movement was started long before the <span class="caps">OSS</span> movement, and the <span class="caps">OSS</span> language was brought about to entice more corporate involvement. It was thought that in some circles 'free' equated to 'bad' , you get what you pay for.<br /><br /><a href=http://mako.yukidoke.org/copyrighteous/freesoftware/20041231-00.html>Mako</a> said:<br /><br />'<i>While the ideology of open source seems to be waning in popularity, the term "open source" is growing in strength. More importantly, the software itself is bigger than ever and growing quickly. In Spain, regional governments are embracing "open source" and software libre. In Munich, in Brazil, and in non-profit organizations and schools around the globe, "open source" is a familiar phrase.</i>â€<br /><br />Anyways, what does this all mean, you ask?<br /><br />I am a proponent of <span class="caps">OSS</span>/FOSS (to be called Free Software from now on), and I wanted to take a moment to explain why.<br /><br />If you recall (or read my archives) in one of the first posts, I talked about <a href=http://www.ubuntulinux.org/>Ubuntu Linux as my distribution of choice, because I believed in what they were doing and the language that they used.<br /><br />For me, Free Software is about empowerment. It empowers common people, what ever their lot in life, to have the most powerful tools at their hands. With <a href=http://www.openoffice.org/>Open Office, anyone can create professional looking documents, spreadsheets and presentions, and not have to pay hundreds of dollars for the right. People can have a safe computing experience, practically immune to the spate of worms, viruses, and other garbage that threatens Internet users today. They can be assured of their right to privacy, knowing full well that their Operating System is not sending reports about what software they have installed, nor recording how many times the hardware in their machine is changed. It takes the power away from an elite few, and gives it back to the masses. <br /><br />But software is expensive to develop, you proclaim! Who is going to pay the salary of all of these people?<br /><br />Some do it for the love of the software, on their weekends. Some are hired by major corporations who service the software, or sell hardware to go along with the software, to insure that their needs are met. <a href=http://www-136.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/index.html><span class="caps">IBM</span></a>, <a href=http://developer.novell.com/ndk/qstart/opensource.htm>Novell</a> and <a href=http://developer.apple.com/darwin/>Apple are companies that embody this new economy. <span class="caps">IBM</span> and Novell have teams of developers who work on <span class="caps">OSS</span>/FOSS projects, to insure that their needs are met with the next release. Novell has teams of people working on the Gnome Desktop, <span class="caps">KDE</span> Desktop, Linux Kernel, Mono and many others. <span class="caps">IBM</span> works on many of the same projects, and funds many others. Apple (with the advent of their rocking <span class="caps">OS X</span>) has switched to <span class="caps">BSD</span> internals and gives back much of the work that they do.<br /><br />Now, these are simply companies, with their bottom line to watch out for, so not all have done a fantastic job over the years. It's been fits and starts for a while, but the future is bright indeed.<br /><br />From the <a href=http://www.ubuntulinux.org>Ubuntu Linux</a> Homepage:<br /><br /><i>* Ubuntu will always be free of charge, and there is no extra fee for the "enterprise edition", we make our very best work available to everyone on the same Free terms. <br /><br />* Ubuntu includes the very best in translations and accessibility infrastructure that the Free Software community has to offer, to make Ubuntu usable by as many people as possible. <br /><br />* Ubuntu is released regularly and predictably; a new release is made every six months. You can use the current stable release or the current development release. Each release is supported for at least 18 months. <br /><br />* Ubuntu is entirely committed to the principles of open source software development; we encourage people to use open source software, improve it and pass it on.</i><br /><br />-Tsyko</p>]]></content:encoded>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, I <a href=http://tsykoduk.blogspot.com/2005/01/open-source-software.html>ranted at length</a> about the meaning of <span class="caps">FOSS</span> and <span class="caps">OSS</span>. I think just about everything has been said about <span class="caps">OSS</span> development that can be. We all know that it is a better development model because all of the code is open for world wide peer review. We also know that if you have the desire, you can review the code yourself and assure yourself that it is indeed secure. While this is not an option for most home users, large enterprises can use this option to assure their security and modify the code to do what they need.<br /><br />All of that is well and good. However, for me this whole Free Software movement is more about compassion. While this seems to be a strange link - think of this. If I live in a third world country, and I start a small business, am I going to be able to afford paying the fees to stand up a Windows based Email Server, Web Server, Firewall Server, and put computers with Office and Windows (as well as the all-pervasive virus scanners, spy ware blockers, workstation firewalls, ad naseum) on all of my employees desks? How am I to secure and lock these machines down so that I am sure that my employees are not just playing solitaire and browsing the web? Can I compete with the large company that buys computers by the pallet from Dell?<br /><br />I propose that Free Software would be a better option. There are industrial strength firewalls, servers, email systems and more. Just about every program that you use has been recreated. I personally use <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">The Gimp</a> for my photo editing, Open Office for my word processing and spreadsheet needs. I use Ubuntu Linux at home as my primary Operating System. I do have a dual boot on one of my machines into Windows XP, but weeks can go by with out my booting into it.<br /><br />Now, just because you use Windows does not mean that you have to let the wonders of Free Software. Open Office, The Gimp and many other applications have been ported back to windows.<br /><br />Heh. Ported 'back' to Windows.<br /><br />Anyways, why would I want to use an office package that costs $600 and is upgraded every few years, when I can download and use Open Office for free? Open office reads and writes Microsoft Office 2000 files pretty much seamlessly , so sharing with my work computer is not a problem.<br /><br />In fact, I often throw files from work on my thumb drive, take it home, plug in into my Linux Box and work on them. I take them back to work, and open them in Microsoft Office. No headaches, no muss.<br /><br />My firewall at home is running on a Pentium 90 with 64 megs of <span class="caps">RAM</span> and a two gig Hard Drive. I swapped it out with a Netgear router/firewall and noticed no difference in speed or latency. So, now I have the Netgear on the 'outside' facing the Internet, and serving wireless to my laptop. Inside of that is my 'ol firewall, running IP Tables and Linux. Inside of that are my desktops and my server. <span class="caps">A VPN</span> punches through the firewall to give my laptop access to my files and printers.<br /><br />All of this cost me 1 Netgear wireless AP and Router. No software costs, and it's all legal. I think that's the best thing about this. I am honoring the licenses of all of the software that I run. I really dislike people that steal others property. When you pirate software, you are stealing. When you use Free Software, you are not stealing, since it is free to use, and give to others.<br /><br />So, obey the license restrictions of the software that you use. If you want to try Open Source, check out this <a href="http://theopencd.sunsite.dk/">CD</a>. It has a bunch of open source software for windows that you can use.<br /><br />Play Nice!<br /><br /><br /><br />-Tsyko</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://emilyscraziness.blogspot.com/2005/01/back-to-governor-thing.html">emily</a> has this to say<br /><br />"<i>...Personally, I think that the fact that the results have been changed and victory has been declared over 120-something votes (after people criticizing a so-called victory of 420 votes) is a little out-of-whack. If you still care (and are a voter for WA), you can find the petition for a re-vote <a href=http://www.revotewa.com/petition.htm>here</a>. I don't have time at the moment for a longer post than this. Later!</i>"<br /><br />Can't agree more. Click on through, nothing to see here citizen.<br /><br />-Tsyko<br /></p>]]></content:encoded>

Yes, the means in which we got here are disappointing, but whats done is done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gregoire isn't the end of the world, and we would be better served by just moving on, and using that moral highground to try and achieve a victory with enough margins so it can't be questioned next time.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I voted for Rossi, and it was not an uninformed vote.  As Attorney General of WA, Gregoire published multiple memos (and related work) during her tenure used for the edification of LE officers statewide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gregoire is so far to the left on matters of criminal justice I always had a hard time believing she was actually AG.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, I have become somewhat apathetic towards politics and our political process.  I feel that in the grand scheme of the universe it matters not one whit who is voted into what office.  Life will go on, and those of us down here in &quot;Honest-day's-work-for-an-honest-day's-pay&quot; Land will continue to shuffle along at our own pace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's up to -&gt;us&lt;- to be happy.

I don't really care which one wins, I just want to make sure that it is fair and above board. I cannot say that about the current election.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>It is reasonable to doubt. Doubt arises when there is rational thinking. Come you Kalamas, do not go by reports, by dogmatism, by traditions, by holy scripture, by rational argument, by logical reasoning, by inference from observation, by views based on mystical experience, by probability, or by faith in a teacher. When you know for yourself that, "these experiences are not good, these experiences are faulty, these experiences are deplored by intelligent people; these experiences, when undertaken and carried out, lead to harm and to suffering", then you should abandon them.

	<p>When you know for yourselves that, "these experiences are good; these experiences are not faulty, these experiences are praised by the wise; these experiences, when undertaken and carried out, lead to welfare and happiness"... then you should enter and remain in them.</p>

Initial data taken by the robot's Mini-Thermal Emission Spectrometer (Mini-TES) is suggestive that the odd-looking "rock" is made of metal.</i><br /><br />It's just amazing that this probe is still doing good science like this. A fantasic investment for the world made by the <span class="caps">USA</span>.<br /><br />It's incredible - in the same week we land a probe on Titan - one of the more likely objects to have an 'interesting' surface, and a really old probe finds a 'strange' thing just lying about on Mars.<br /><br />There should be some really intresting news coming out of <span class="caps">NASA</span> over the next few months.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<center><a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/cassini/multimedia/huygens-2.html"><span class="caps">NASA</span> - Huygens at Titan</a>:<br /></center><br /><center><img src=http://www.nasa.gov/images/content/105736main_Crop448-H2.jpg/></center><br /><br /><i>This is one of the first raw images returned by the European Space Agency's Huygens probe during its successful descent to Titan. It was taken from an altitude of 16.2 kilometers (about 10 miles) with a resolution of approximately 40 meters (about 131 feet) per pixel. It apparently shows short, stubby drainage channels leading to a shoreline.</i><br /><br />Wow. They said <i>shoreline</i>. There are more great pictures at the <a href=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/cassini/main/index.html><span class="caps">NASA</span></a> site and the <a href=http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/Cassini-Huygens/index.html><span class="caps">ESA</span></a> site.<br /><br />The theory that Titan has had liquid seas has always really intrigued me. I guess that liquid of some sort seems like a prequsite for life to spring forth. So, we really have 3 likely objects for life in the solar system. Titan, Europa and Earth. We know that there is life on earth, but the jury is still out on if it's sustainable or not. Europa, with the possiblity of liquid water under it's icey exterior, would be a strange place indeed for life to spring up. Titan, enshrouded in a cloudy mantle has always been a question mark.<br /><br />Huygens is starting to peirce that mantle. Since this is a joint operation of <span class="caps">NASA</span>, European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency we hope that any really stunning findings will not be quashed.<br /><br />]]></content:encoded>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was driving around the blog-o-sphere last nite, and I came across a mention of <a href=http://www.google.com/search?q=back+flab&#38;start=0&#38;start=0&#38;ie=utf-8&#38;oe=utf-8&#38;client=firefox&#38;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:unofficial>Back Flab</a> at <a href=http://poorrolemodel.blogspot.com/2005/01/beauty-tips-vs-ugly-tips.htm>PoorRoleModel</a>. Now this got me thinking. And jiggling. <br /><br />Do I have back flab? <br /><br />How can I tell? I do not often actually <b>look</b> at my back. So, sitting in the <a href=http://www.ai.mit.edu/people/paulfitz/spanish/index.html>Comfy Chair</a> I started to jiggle my back. To see if it would, infact, jiggle.<br /><br />Sadly, no jiggling.<br /><br />Well, no jiggling on my back.<br /><br />I guess I will have to work harder if I want to get some back flab of my own. Or perhaps I could just go out and buy some?<br /><br />I think that I should research companys that sell back flab. When this gets out, there is going to be a run on this stuff, and their stock could do better then a <a href=http://www.zoology.ubc.ca/~bwilson/herring.html>dry herring</a> at a <a href=http://www.everythingferret.com/gastrointestinal_disorders_in_ferrets.htm>ferret eating</a> contest.<br /><br /><br /><br /></p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am currently reading '<a href=http://www.randomhouse.com/crown/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=1400080797>The Quantum and the Lotus</a>' , a very good book. It talks about the convergence between modern scientific theory and Buddhist philosophy.<br /><br />One of the passages talks about how reality is an illusion, and how we collectivity determine what reality is. Now this has interesting ramifications. For example, if you were to live in a culture where everyone believed in pixies, then perhaps they would actually exist, as far as that culture extended.<br /><br />How can that be?<br /><br />I will take a example that they used in the book, and expand on it a bit.<br /><br />Say, that you are a person living on an island in a river. To one side, there is a farmhouse, and to the other side there is a copse of trees. There is a rainbow above, that stretches from the farmhouse to the copse of trees.<br /><br />From your perspective, being confined to that island , would it not be easy to believe that the rainbow comes from the farmhouse and stretches across the sky, and your entire universe, to the copse of trees? What sort of belief structure would you come up with? Would you venerate the farmhouse and trees? What would you feel about the little figures that you could see living in the farmhouse?<br /><br /><center><i>Meditate on what life and your beliefs would be like living on that island.</i></center><br /><br />Now, say, you were plucked off the island, and placed into the farmhouse's front yard. Would the experience live up to the beliefs? Where would the rainbow be , that you had seen coming from the farmhouse? What would that do to your world view and beliefs?<br /><br />Reality really depends on the observer. A cat, dog, insect and human have radically different views of what reality is. Is any of their views less probable, or less real then ours? How about the world view of a bat, that only sees thought reflected sound?<br /><br />I propose that what we call reality is in fact a convenient illusion, created in part by our minds to deal with the world around us, and in part created by the collective beliefs of all of us to provide a common frame of reference to enable communication. <br /><br />Reality is <b>taught</b> to us by our community and our parents.<br /><br /><br />-Tsyko<br /></p>]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The more that I delve into Buddhism, the more that I think Lucas got some of his ideas for the Jedi from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was talking to a co-worker on a drive yesterday, and I  brough up a theory that I have had for a long time: Reality has inerta. This inerta is created by the belief/perception of other people and the ingrained belief that you yourself carry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reality is determined by your perception, your belief and the interta of reality. So, in past times when people belived that supernatural events happened regularly, there was less inerta working against such acts it would have been 'easier' to preform them.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I saw that book and I was considering picking it up. I like science. I like Buddhism. Seemed like a winning combination to me. I always find myself thinking about unanswerable questions (i.e., what is mind, what is reality, is there a life essence beyond the body, why do I constantly waste my time).

In thinking about reality and perception I guess I feel that there are some things which we may or may not know (reality) and then there is our best determination (perception) of reality based on our limited ability to see the &quot;truth.&quot; Perception is the tip of the iceberg while reality is everything that you can and cannot see. I know this is a bad analogy but it makes me think about statistics and type I and type II errors. I'm going to end up talking myself into a oneway street, so I'll leave it at that.

No doubt Lucus incorporated samurai code into Jedi behavior.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I really liked the book.

&lt;i&gt; Perception is the tip of the iceberg while reality is everything that you can and cannot see.&lt;/i&gt;

I agree. Like the four blind men and the elephant. We do not see reality, we could not comprehend it's fullness.]]></wp:comment_content>

These are dukkha (explained above), anicca (impermanence), and anattÃ¡ (insubstantiality, "no-soul"). The attributes of God are not consistent with these universal marks of existence. Thus God must be free from dukkha; he must be eternal (and hence not subject to anicca); finally he must have a distinct unchanging identity (and therefore lack the characteristic of anattÃ¡)."</i></center><br /><br />From <a href="http://www.buddhistinformation.com/buddhist_attitude_to_god.htm">The Buddhist Attitude to God</a><br /><br />If God exists, and he/she/it is omnibenevolent as the teachings of the christian church have us belive, then what about evil?

Why would he create all of these things that are meant to harm us, cause us pain, and kill us painfully?<br /><br />Forget Human evilness - let's talk about cancer and TB and Tsunami's!<br /><br />Just some things I am currently pondering...<br /><br /></p>]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[This is of course a question that has long puzzled theologists.  To me, it doesn't seem all that difficult in that the answer is that what we percieve as 'evil' or 'bad' is evil only from our current, mortal perspective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an example:  I know that you are a GM for role playing games.  In this activity, you are the 'God' of the world you create.  I am sure that even though you are probably a 'Good' GM, you visit calamities and misfortune on the poor people of your created world.  Even though you may wipe out entire planets with a whim, this is a 'Good' thing because it makes the world interesting and enjoyable for the players of your game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you think about yourself as God, the players as immortal, eternal souls, and the characters as the mortal bodies those souls temporalily live in you should be able to easily see how what appears as 'evil' to the characters is in fact good for the players.  Role-playing in a world without conflict, where nothing bad ever could or would happen would not be a very worthwhile experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I don't know if we are here simply for the 'fun' of it or if there is more to it than that (I strongly suspect the latter) but I can certainly see at even that level how 'Good' and 'Evil' can be quite different depending on one's perspective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course having 'evil' things happen to you and doing evil are two different things and may have entirely different consequences from an eternal perspective.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I wonder if being a polytheist is why I rarely find myself pondering things of this nature. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't really believe in &quot;evil,&quot; and I certainly don't believe in &quot;The Devil&quot; (though I do believe that the a Christian god exists.) I just never find myself wondering why the gods allow or visit &quot;evil&quot; upon mortals. I'm not entirely sure why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though I suspect that also believing in a form of predestination and reincarnation probably has something to do with that as well.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[There are other issues with an omni-whatever deity as well. The Problem of Evil is just one that sticks hardest for me. If God were no Omni then, these logical problems keep coming up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even in a fictional game world - no one is Omni. As the game progresses, things happen that the GM (god?) did not plan for. There is also randomness. Diffrent story completly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Christian God is said to be All-Knowing, and All-Powerful&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If He knows everything, then he already knows the outcome of every event ever to happen and that will happen. If he is All-Powerful, then He has the ability to change outcomes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With His All-Knowing, he would already know the outcome of His changes, making picking the path that would lead to all people being happy and content trivial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, yet, he does not. There is senseless killing, and more importantly, senseless suffering happening each and every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If He has the knowledge and the power, why does He not fix it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I posit that he does not have the knowledge and power to fix it. I do not feel that He is as cruel as having that knowledge and power and not using it would make him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, off my soapbox ;)]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[If making all people happy and contented is a good thing, then you would be correct in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I fall back on the idea that being given happiness and contentment is not in fact good for us or in fact desirable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An interesting (and entertaining) exploration of this idea can be found in Orson Scott Card's The Worthing Saga.  If you haven't read it, I highly recommend it.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I think that happyiness is the ultimate goal. Each of us must be responsible for our own happiness. We also must do what we can to spread happiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;I saw young children who have lost their hands. I asked one how, and he said by sword, by the Janjaweed [militia]&quot; - from &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.blogger.com/r?http%3A%2F%2Fdavejustus.blogspot.com%2F2005%2F01%2Fdarfur-genocide.html%23comments&quot;&gt;Justus For All&lt;/A&gt;If a person, with the means and ability to stop this kind of action, were to stand by and allow it to happen, would that not be condoning via non-action, or at the very least neglect?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If a person could have simply given a warning about the Tsunami, and saved countless thousands of lives, and chose not to - how would that person be judged in world opinion if that fact came out?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yet people accept an omnipotent God standing by and not doing anything. And they say He Loves Us most of all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The book of Job is an excellent example of this. God allowed a follower of his to loose his family, livelihood, everything. On a &lt;B&gt;bet&lt;/B&gt;. If a person were to do half of what happened to Job to someone and the police were to find out, they would be in some pretty serious trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that was just &quot;testing his faith&quot;. Cannot God see inside of us, what we truly are and believe? Why then must he &quot;test our faith&quot; with trials and tribulations?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot believe that God is so small, callous and immature as this. This is why the only thing that I can believe is, if he does exist, that he is not omnipotent, omnipresent and omniscient. That he is bound by the same laws of the universe that we are. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps he is on a different plane of existence, perhaps he has powers that are incredible, but he cannot know everything that is going to happen, and cannot have the power to effect the entire universe at the snap of a finger.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Sure, and a large purple chicken laid the Earth, and we have lived in chaos ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem with deity discussions is it always assumes the existence of some mystical being, or beings, that are on some separate plane of reality and playing with man-kind on Earth like some twisted cosmic role-playing game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no God, no Goddess, no large purple chicken that decides the fate of mankind.  It is a natural order of things that plays by the rules that have evolved along with the universe in which we live.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just because we cannot understand how the universe works does not mean some super-being must have created it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know many folks enjoy the serenity of believing that there surely must be something more to life then just that we live and die.  There must be some heavenly place where we will all go and have BBQ's with our ancestor's when we cease to exist here on our little patch of dirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The truth is, and always will be, we're here on Earth alone without a nasty super-being with a 'tude we can't figure out, to brown-nose for the purpose of gaining entrance to the pearly gates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, this is just my opinion...I could be wrong.  :)]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I think most of us have, for various reasons, let someone we love suffer when we could intervene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The simplist example being disciplining a child because they are doing something dangerous or wrong.  Other examples would be letting someone try something and fail because we knew it was needed for growth even though it would cause pain.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If one accepts the Christian postulate of an immortal soul and an eternal reward than Earthly suffering and even to an extent earthly happiness matter very little.  The fact that someone is killed in a Tsunami may seem like a tradgedy to us, but not to God.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find this viewpoint to at least be internally consistant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to Mystic Knights comments, I have always found atheism to be a very foolish belief system.  Simply put, there is no margin in it.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are right, you get nothing&lt;br /&gt;If you are wrong, you presumably get Hell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If a believer is right, they get Heaven&lt;br /&gt;If a believer is wrong, they get nothing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:)]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[heh heh heh&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to think of myself rather as one of the few on this planet that has ultimately evolved beyond the need for scary stories of the underworld to ensure I do the right thing for my fellow beings on this planet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn't following a religion merely because you are afraid what might happen if you don't seem to be the more foolish approach?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Throughout my life I have chose my course of action based on my studies of the world, its history, its science, and yes, even theology.  What I have discovered is the only path for me.  In fact, my website drones on and on why I feel as I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have moved beyond being frightened what God will do to me if I don't believe in him.  You see, viewing all religion for what it truly is, man-made, removes all of that excess baggage from my psyche and allows me to move on to bigger and better things, like trying to figure out Linux!  :)]]></wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<center><i>"Microsoft has confirmed that they will no longer issue security updates for Windows 2000. In addition, standard support for Windows 2000 is currently scheduled to end in June."</i></center> <br /><br />- From <a href=http://www.osnews.com/comment.php?news_id=9532>OS News</a><br /><br />Wow. Microsoft must be hard up for cash if they are threatining half of their installed base to upgrade or loose support. They have also said that there will be no more browser upgrades until Longhorn - slated to release in '06 or '07 - well past the target date of '04. <br /><br />Win2k to XP is not a small upgrade. Especially <span class="caps">XP SP2</span> - that breaks lots of older applications.<br /><br />Now, more then ever, it is time to look into jumping off the upgrade rollercoaster and switch to a stable OS that has had security in mind for a lot longer then Windows and Microsoft ever had. One where the developers understand that security and useablity can coexist. Check out <a href=http://www.apple.com>Macs</a>, <a href=http://www.debian.org>Some</a> <a href=http://www.ubuntulinux.org>Linux</a> <a href=http://www.novell.com/linux/suse/index.html>Distro</a> or <a href=http://www.freebsd.org/><span class="caps">BSD</span>.<br /><br />]]></content:encoded>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><a href=http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=meme>meme</a> n. A unit of cultural information, such as a cultural practice or idea, that is transmitted verbally or by repeated action from one mind to another</blockquote><br /><br /><blockquote>Richard Dawkins's term for an idea considered as a replicator, especially with the connotation that memes parasitise people into propagating them much as viruses do.<br /><br />Memes can be considered the unit of cultural evolution. Ideas can evolve in a way analogous to biological evolution. Some ideas survive better than others; ideas can mutate through, for example, misunderstandings; and two ideas can recombine to produce a new idea involving elements of each parent idea.

	<p>The term is used especially in the phrase "meme complex" denoting a group of mutually supporting memes that form an organized belief system, such as a religion. However, "meme" is often misused to mean "meme complex".</p>


	<p>Use of the term connotes acceptance of the idea that in humans (and presumably other tool- and language-using sophonts) cultural evolution by selection of adaptive ideas has become more important than biological evolution by selection of hereditary traits. Hackers find this idea congenial for tolerably obvious reasons.</blockquote></p>


	<p>Memes in general are a very interesting concept. Ideas can be like mental 'viruses'. They want to survive, and they can (and do) spread.<br /><br /><blockquote>The term is used especially in the phrase "meme complex" denoting a group of mutually supporting memes that form an organized belief system, such as a religion.</blockquote></p>


	<p>A set of interrelated memes can make up a 'Meme Complex'. These groups of ideas are interrelated and co-supporting. They strengthen and reinforce each other - making the group stronger then the whole. A religion is an example of a Meme Complex. Many of the ideas central to religion are intersupporting. For example the Christian belief that a life time of good works, and belief in the Christian Religion (Meme Complex) will garner great rewards after death.</p>


	<p>This sort of interrelationship with in a Meme Complex makes the entire thing stronger, and that much more survivable in the 'wild'. In the world of Memes, it is survival of the fittest. Early Memes were probably very simple (Sun God Hot). Over time, the stronger ones survived, combined and slowly merged into more and more complex structures.</p>


	<p>This whole system is very like biological evolution. Not the our uncles were monkeys theories, but rather the 'Real' Theory of Evolution - that things change over time when exposed to environmental pressure. Not that some of my monkeys are not uncles...</p>


	<p>One of the methods that biological things evolve is through mutation. Not X-Men style mutation, but rather small changes over time. The changes that allow for better survival (and ultimately reproduction) will 'stick' and the ones that make it harder to survive will tend to be weeded out.</p>


	<p>Anyways - so we have ideas or concepts that are able to propagate, change in response to environmental pressures, and grow stronger by merging with other ideas, or simple mutation through errors in transmission (remember the telephone game from Kindergarten?).</p>


So..
<blockquote><a href=http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=toxic>toxÂ·ic</a> adj. <i>1. Of,  relating to, or caused by a toxin or other poison. 2. Capable of causing injury or death, especially by chemical means; poisonous.</i></blockquote>

	<p>Some Memes or Meme Complexes might become Toxic. They might damage the host in order to propagate more efficiently, or have some aim that is not for the best of the host or host's group. I believe that Toxic Memes are one of the more pressing issues that we, as a culture and race, face at this time. These diseases of the psyche must be investigated, and some form of inoculation or treatment be found.</p>


	<p>A few of the Toxic Memes that come to mind are things like Fanaticism of any sort - be it Christian, Muslim, or Ice Cream Loving. Several of the political belief systems fall into this category as well. Communism and Fascism come to mind.</p>


	<p>We need to find, create, sow, water and release into the wild Memes and Meme Complexes that are strong, positive, and very contagious. We need to debunk Toxic Memes, to show where they are not healthy for the carriers, and supplant them with the Meme of Love.</p>


	<p>-Tsyko</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>Mike Sarakinsky, University of South Africa:<br /><br />"I have never ordered red tape, but have been tied up by it here at the university. About 12 years ago, I needed 20 sheets of blank white A4 paper for an article I was typing. The only place to get 20 such sheets was the photocopy room. I duly requested the 20 sheets of blank paper from a photocopy assistant. He said he could not give me the sheets, but if I filled in the requisition form, he could give me 20 copies of a blank sheet of paper. Astonished, I filled in the form. Then he proceeded to actually make 20 copies of a blank sheet on the photocopier. He explained that at the end of the day, his supervisor counted the sheets of paper, read the counter on the copier machine, checked that these corresponded with the requisition forms and compared the information with the previous day's numbers. If there was any discrepancy, the fellow had to pay the difference."</i><br /><br />From this <a href=http://education.guardian.co.uk/egweekly/story/0,,1402413,00.html>article</a> posted about <a href=http://improbable.typepad.com/improbable_research_whats/2005/02/guardian_column.html>here</a>.<br /><br />Sounds like some places that I have worked..<br /></p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the hardest things that I face on a day-to-day basis is how to feel compassion for certain people. It is quite hard sometimes, to still feel compassion in the face of aggression or general nastiness. Being far from Buddhahood, I am often not with out fault in this matter. <br /><br />Over the years, I have grown quite a bit. When I was in JR. High school, I would often lash out with anger and violence. I was often sent to the office, or to detention for various nasty angry things that I did. I am not proud of that time in my life - however it was what made me today. I have grown past that in most cases now, and it takes great effort to move me to anger.<br /><br />But whose effort? Some times it is my effort - some times a mixture of others and mine. But never is it just some one else's fault. <i>It takes two to tango</i>, trite and overused - but trite and overused for a reason. It really does take two people to engage in nastiness.<br /><br />Compassion can de-escalate a situation. If you can respond with compassion at all times, the angry ones have a hard time responding with anger. Note that I did not say could not. There are people that have so much pain in side that they cannot help but to lash out. I know people like this, and they can be very hard to deal with.<br /><br />"...<i>Buddhist ethical principles are very noble and in an ideal world their practice would lead to peace and harmony but, unfortunately, as the Buddha has taught, people are motivated by greed hatred and delusion - even Buddhists. </i>"<br /><br />From <a href=http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/budethics.htm>Buddhanet</a><br /><br />-Tsyko<br /></p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a stunning study, <a href=http://offtheshelf.nowis.com/index.cfm?ID=5>Off the Shelf</a> muses about the diffrences between stealing a season of <a href="http://abc.go.com/primetime/alias/">Alias</a> online vs offline. If you were to fire up <a href="http://bittorrent.com/">Bittorrent</a> and download it, you could be liable for up to $3,400,000, 1 year jail time, lawyer fees and Court Costs. So, if you were to slip on that ol' trench coat and saunter down to <a href="http://www.gohastings.com/catalog/">Hastings</a> and slip out with a copy of that, you could be liable for $100,000 and 1 year in jail.<br /><br />Just makes me wonder.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://mako.yukidoke.org/copyrighteous/">Mako says</a>:<br /><br /><i><blockquote>Many people are worried about the nasty privacy implications <del>- realized and potential -</del> of supermarket and chain store "loyalty" cards. As <span class="caps">RFID</span> chips are introduced, things get even more scary.<br /><br />In an attempt to attack supermarkets' data-mining operation and to gain a new shopping identity in the process, many people have taken to swapping cards with each other. Over the last few years, I've been among these people.<br /><br />A couple years ago, a few friends and I came up with the idea of creating a sort of online loyalty card swap-meet where people could come and exchange their supermarket or chain-store loyalty cards with total strangers from the privacy of their own homes. Some other people have arranged to swap numbers for particular stores but our idea was to swap the actual cards from any store that uses a card. We actually built most of it but got hung up at the last minute on a couple of details and with writing some of the explanatory text.<br /><br />Last night, I made the final push and finished the code and set everything up and seeded the database with the lists of as many supermarkets that I know use loyalty cards as listed on <span class="caps">CASPIAN</span>'s supermarket list.<br /><br />If you've got an extra card (and maybe if you don't), go ahead and sign up to swap! This is one of those things that works better when more people do it so tell your friends and spread the word.<br /><br />Information and the card-swapping apparatus is all online at: <a href=http://cardexchange.org>cardexchange.org</a></blockquote></i><br /><br />Sounds like a very cool idea to me. I very well might be trying this new service out. One of the cool things that I have noticed, is the checkers at one of my local chain stores keep their cards with them, and use them if the customer does not have a card. Gets us the savings, and saves the planet from Big Brother.<br /><br />- Tsyko</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.macworld.co.uk/news/index.cfm?RSS&amp;NewsID=10827">Macworld UK - PC makers want to license Mac OS</a><br /><br /><blockquote><i>"Apple has to fight off three of the biggest PC companies, sick of the security bugs that plague Windows, wanting to license the Mac operating system.<br /><br />The revelation came in a <a href="http://www.fortune.com/fortune/technology/articles/0,15114,1025093,00.html">Fortune </a> magazine interview with Apple <span class="caps">CEO</span> Steve Jobs, described by <a href="http://macdailynews.com/index.php/weblog/comments/4950/">MacDailyNews</a> as 'an embarrassment of riches' because it is so full of information."</i></blockquote><br /><br />Sounds like a really good idea to me. There would be some technical issues at first, however I think that with a <a href=http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/hcl/default.mspx>Hardware Compablity List</a> (like so many other vendors have published) it would be a good thing.<br /><br />Apple hardware would still be superior - the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerPC>PowerPC</a> chips are better then Intel/AMD's, and Apple has the market cornered on Cool.<br /><br />-Tsyko</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>And not really caring. Most of the pre-digested pabulum that they play is just crap. I really dislike where modern Pop music has gone. Record execs in silver towers make choices based on what will make <b>them</b> the most money, rather then what is good music.<br /><br />Television it's self is mostly crap now days. Shela likes to watch a lot of TV. Well, a lot in my mind. When we met I did have a TV. But it was only hooked up to my Playstation and <span class="caps">DVD</span> player. Not even bunny ears. I had no need for TV. I used the heck out of <a href=http://www.netflix.com>Netflix</a>. I had to increase my subscription to 8 movies at home because I would blow through 4 or 5 movies in a weekend, and I liked to have one or two for the week.<br /><br />I also did a lot of computing - errr - playing on the computers at home then as well. Now I am relegated to the laptop on a lazy boy, trying to ignore the TV. <br /><br />Oh - god - Ricky Martin. I think that I am going to be sick. In Spanish. :)<br /><br />This Ricky Martin/J-Lo thing reminds me of a movie - Four Rooms. Especially the part with Antonio Banderas. Cool stuff.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a> writes:<br /><br /><blockquote>Criminals posing as legitimate businesses have accessed critical personal data stored by ChoicePoint Inc., a firm that maintains databases of background information on virtually every U.S. citizen. The incident involves a wide swath of consumer data, including names, addresses, Social Security numbers, credit reports and other information. ChoicePoint notified between 30,000 and 35,000 consumers in California that their personal data may have been accessed by 'unauthorized third parties.' No obvious notice appears to be on their website.</blockquote><br /><br />Wow. Scary. Read <a href="http://www.epic.org/privacy/choicepoint/">this</a> for some background about who uses Choicepoint and what kind of services and data they provide.<br /><br />One would have hoped that a company that deals with such sensitive data would have stronger safeguards in place. Hopefully this breach is a wake up call for them and the rest out there...<br /><br />-Tsyko</p>]]></content:encoded>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So - there are several logical problems with the concept of God. I would like to explore a few of them right now.<br /><br />Let's assume that God is omni-whatever.<br /><br />Where does he live?<br /><br />Time is woven into the fabric of our universe. As space stretches and warps, time is stretched and warped the same.  Time and space are basically the same thing. This is not a theory - it has been experimentally proven several times since the big E proposed it.<br /><br />Time is also subjective, rather then objective. We determine time's flow in our brain and nervous system. It is not some universal constant, rather a construct of our psychology and physiology.  You can see that yourselves. When you are bored, the hours seem to drag on. When you are focused and busy, time seems to just fly by.<br /><br />I think that we can also all agree that every event has a cause. Things do not 'just happen' on their own. If a tree falls in a forest, it is because something caused it to fall. Gravity, breakdown at the cellular level causing structural failure, wind - some thing caused it to fall. There can be no event with out some cause.<br /><br />All this said, where does God live? In our universe, or some place external?<br /><br />Let's look at each option (and there are only two - here or there)<br /><br />Here - God lives in our universe. There are a few complications that this raises.<br /><br />If He lives here, then he would be bound by the rules in effect here. He would be bound by Time, and therefore would not know everything. He could not know every cause and effect, because some effects have not happened, and the effects that they cause are not know.<br /><br />Also - if he lives here, how did he create the universe that he is part of? If he in fact He lives here, then he would have been created when the universe was created - as He is part of it<br /><br />Ok, so that does not work.<br /><br />He must live out side of our universe.<br /><br />But wait - if Time is an integral part of our universe, then he must live in a different time stream. If He lives in a different universe with different time, then how could he effect our universe with it's own time? If our time does not effect Him, then our universe would be created and destroyed in no time in His universe. So, if he were to have created our universe, it would be over before any time passed in his time stream.<br /><br />And, if he exists in another universe - what caused him? Every event has a cause, so what caused him? Did He have parents?<br /><br />-Tsyko</p>]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Richard Bach had an interesting analogy in his book Illusions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically he equated our lives/world with a movie and God or the God's or whatever's world with our world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The characters in the movie expirience time in a definate progression, from their point of view everything happens in order and the future is unpredictable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, someone outside, in the real world, sees the movie as being a static artifact.  The future is predictable, everthing is knowable.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be impossible for any of the characters inside the movie to determine anything for certain about the movie maker or what his world was like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course this analogy is imperfect.  Free will does not exist for the characters in a movie (although the illusion of it does) but it is an interesting way to think about this sort of problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course the ultimate answer is, &quot;It's a mystery.&quot;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps that is not very satisfing, but I for one am a little unwilling to abandon the idea at least that the mysterious and the unknowable may in fact exist.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I would agree that just because we cannot comprehend something does not make it untrue. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several issues with the motion picture analogy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, the watchers of the movie cannot effect the movie. The plot of the movie is already set in stone, as it were.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We can no more cause changes in the Matrix then an outsider could in that enviroment. If the outcome is already known, and the causes are already in place, then there is no wiggle room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, If the 'outsider' sees this world as a static artifact, and can 'fast forward' to see what the outcomes are, then we live in a deterministic world - everything is already determined and we have no choice in the matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The issue of free will is the crux of this matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess that I have a hard time with that. I would rather that my actions and choices were not pre-destined. If we destiny is in fact guiding our every act, thought and deed - then why should we try to better ourselves? Why should we attempt to reach beyond what we know?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A pre-destined world is a sad place to live, IMO. And we come a full 180 back to the question of suffering.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I did point out the free will problem in my original comment and I agree with you there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most useful thing about the analogy in my mind is that it does demonstrate well that a different persepective, a different frame of reference, can make the same thing look very different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From a movie watchers point of view a movie is much different from a movie character's point of view, even though the movie is the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One could probably better construct an analogy with a virtual reality world (even something like EverQuest or the Sims) with God being the designer/programmer and the characters being us humans.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kind of like the idea of us as humans (in the real world) having a strong analogy to this idea, where a portion of us is a mortal being (the character and part of the world) and a portion of us is immortal and outside of it (the human player behind the character.)]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[There's a third choice: what if God &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; the Universe?

For instance: are you inside or outside your body?  It's the exact same question.

Point to the part that contains &quot;you&quot;.  Which neuron is it?  Which part of the brain?  Which synapses?

Or are you just the sum of your perceptions?

Here's the basic problem with your question:
You understand Euclidean Geometry, right?
There are an infinite number of points in a line.  How can that be?  At some point, you should get to an ultimate 'smallness' and be able to start counting, right?  But that's just an aside.
So take that line of infinite points...and now, without leaving the line, describe a plane.
You can't do it.
You need at least two lines to describe a plane.
But from the perspective of a point, the plane doesn't exist; &lt;i&gt;can't&lt;/i&gt; exist.

Likewise, from points within that plane, attempt to describe a three-dimensional object.

Again, you can't do it.  The 3-D object &lt;i&gt;cannot&lt;/i&gt; be described with only two dimensions.

The 4th dimension is Time.  A solid object in and of itself cannot be described in 'time' without moving within that dimension.  We talk about 'along' the timestream, but that's just our perception, because we do move from the past to the future.

So, what if there were a fifth dimension (and I'm not talking about the soul group). How would you detect it or even know it was there?

Rather than trying to locate God in the dimensions you know, consider again:

Something that has freedom of motion in 3 dimensions would not be within the perceptions of something restricted to just 2.  You can see that right?  If you can't leave the plane you are in, how can you detect me when I leave the plane for a different, perpendicular plane?  I would cease to exist to your perceptions, but I would still perceive you, and be able to act on you.

I will spare you the same comparison between a plan and a line, and a line and point.

About suffering...well, is suffering always bad?  Have you ever worked out?  Some suffering leads to growth, and some suffering prevents even greater suffering later on.

Do you have kids?  Do you control every aspect of their lives to prevent any suffering whatsoever?  Does a 14-year-old who is prevented from going out with their friends &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; understand how minor that depravation is?  Probably not.

Have you ever known a person whose parents managed to prevent the child from experiencing even 10% of the normal suffering of life?  The ones &lt;i&gt;I've&lt;/i&gt; seen weren't worth a crap.

...and that's even aside from the idea that most of the suffering we experience in this life is due to the selfish decisions of sinful people.

That's only a scant introduction to the wonderful world of theology.  I'll be back to check your disagreements later. [grin] ]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[So, I should belive in something &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; it's not provable?

&quot;&lt;em&gt;Something that has freedom of motion in 3 dimensions would not be within the perceptions of something restricted to just 2. You can see that right? If you can't leave the plane you are in, how can you detect me when I leave the plane for a different, perpendicular plane? I would cease to exist to your perceptions, but I would still perceive you, and be able to act on you.&lt;/em&gt;&quot;

However, the flatlander would have no frame of refrence to even comprehend, let alone describe, the object that existed in 3D. So, logically, he could neiter prove nor disprove anything about it. It all comes down to Faith.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Faith: #  Belief that does not rest on logical proof or material evidence. See synonyms at belief, trust.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There is no way to hold a conherent discussion where one side is talking about logical reality and the other about Faith.

To quote a freind:

&quot;&lt;em&gt;I just don't understand any intellectual argument where a invisible deity is involved. What if I told you that I believe the Universe was spawned by a galactic chicken that, in a fit of extreme diarrhea, secreted the cosmos into being. This chicken now demanded gifts of grain annually after a good harvest to insure that next years harvest was bountiful as well. If next years harvest turns out to be bad, then we must have done something to displease the galactic chicken during the past year, and we must now spend 12 days wearing an outfit made from chicken feathers and come together in a pasture to worship him by flapping our arms up and down, scratching in the ground, and clucking?&lt;/em&gt;&quot;

You cannot disprove the Great Chicken. You might not belive that this is true, however there is no way that you can disprove it.

When someone plays the faith card in a logical discussion, it is tanatmount to them saying &quot;I cannot explain it, I just belive it&quot;. Sorry if that does not do it for me. :)

As in court, if some one is to make a claim - they should be able to defend that claim. If in a logical discussion, and they claim the existance of God, there should be some good logical evidence that is true. To just say &quot;Well, it might be like this&quot; is not enough. One should have a logical argument that stands up.

So, in summary - Yes, God could be a Nth dimensional creature that we cannot perceive. However, that does not change the fact that there is no evidence that he exists. Infact, there is evidence that He does not exist. I would ask for what emperical evidence that you have that He does in fact exist.]]></wp:comment_content>

Then see argument #1 - He is bound by time/space - which is part of Him. Logically, you just cannot excape this. If He is part of our universe, then he cannot be omni-whatever because He is bound by the laws of Time and Space that we know to exist.]]></wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From <a href=http://it.slashdot.org/it/05/02/18/1920244.shtml?tid=201&#38;tid=218>Slashdot</a>:<br /><br /><blockquote>The Inquirer has a story that the next generation of Windows spyware and exploits are starting to make use of 'kernel rootkits'. A paper at Microsoft Research has details on a prototype detection tool. Computerworld has more details, as well. From the article: 'Newer rootkits can intercept system calls that are passed to the kernel and filter out queries generated by the software. This makes them invisible to administrators and to detection tools...'</blockquote><br /><br />When are people going to wake up? The era of Windows as we know it is over. There is a race between the hackers and Microsoft, and Microsoft simply cannot keep up. So, I am going to buy a new computer. If I choose Windows, I have to also buy a virus scanner and a spyware scanner, and oh by the way, I might want to buy Office, and a backup program that works, and and and and...<br /><br />From an administrators standpoint, it is suicide to install windows. You simply <b>have</b> to install <span class="caps">SUS</span> or <span class="caps">WUS</span> (the <span class="caps">WUS</span> beta currently out requires a connection to a Microsoft <span class="caps">SQL</span> server), and it's a really good idea to install a centrally controlled workstation firewall, and virus scanner, and spyware scanner, and software inventory and control agent and and and...<br /><br />And yet people still recoil from the Mac, Linux and <span class="caps">BSD</span>. Why? Because 'they are not windows'. So, they spend and spend on all of the supporting infrastructure that running a somewhat secure Windows network requires.<br /><br />Here is a road map to the future for all of you companies stuck in the windows quagmire.<br /><br />1) Get all of you apps running on standards based web platforms (<i>ie</i> no ActiveX, VBScript etc). Use <span class="caps">PHP</span>, MySql and write to <span class="caps">HTML</span> specs.<br /><br />2) The apps that you cannot port to a N-Tier based architecture, get them running using a cross-platform coding tool (Mono w/ <span class="caps">GTK</span>, QT, or what have you).<br /><br />3) Swap out your applications with cross platform ones - ie use Firefox or Mozilla instead of IE. Use Open Office/Star Office instead of Microsoft Office. As your users become used to these tools, it will be trivial to swap out the underlying OS. Most might not even notice.<br /><br />4) Start moving your people to some thing else. - Move the light users first - the ones that only use word, email, and a browser. Power Users can come later. Choose something that keeps your options open - and provides real security.<br /><br />5) Sleep better at night knowing that you have a safer, more secure network.<br /><br />If you need help, email me :)<br /><br /><br />-Tsyko</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In my browsing, I stumbled on <a href=http://www.lex18.com/Global/story.asp?S=2989614>Scary Story</a>. Seems this kid in Highschool wrote a short story about a generic highschool being overrun by Zombies.<br /><br />So, he is being charged, and held for $5,000 bail. For writing a short story. For his English class. Wow.<br /><br />So, I started to do some research, and I found <a href="http://zerointelligence.net/">This Site</a>. Some good stuff there about the fear culture that we currently live in...<br /><br />-Tsyko</p>]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[(I posted this to the site-link about the fear culture.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have kids in public school.  I would darn well like to know that the students around them have enough sense to report the threat-makers when we're talking about BOMBS.  There is a huge difference between &quot;ratting&quot; on someone for a minor infraction, and going to the authorities with information about bomb threats made against public buildings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many of the rants posted so far here with this article are examples of people who have no use for the school system, people who feel the USA is somehow drifting towards a Nazi Germany type of government just because we have laws, or people who want to offer legal interpretations of the issues presented.  The issue here is far more basic...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...it's called &quot;social conscience.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's a big difference between reporting red-light-runners and kids who smoke a little pot (or, maybe even a lot of pot), and reporting kids who make bomb threats; kids who think it is somehow funny in this day-and-age of school shootings and terrorists flying planes into buildings to call in bomb threats at public institutions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is the discipline too harsh (a year of suspension)?  Maybe...but the notion that these kids are doing something noble by not reporting what they know about the bomb threats is unconscionable.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I agree that all credable threats should be investigated. I do not agree with knee-jerk reactions like&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;A fourth-grade student at Wakelee Elementary School in the Wolcott School District was suspended for 10 days for violating the school's zero tolerance policy against weapons. His mother had packed a Boy Scout utensil kit with his lunch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    His mother, Rebecca Glendening, said she thought she had removed the knife attached to the kit, but instead she had mistakenly removed a can-opener tool.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(from that site)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;or the Zombie story that I wrote about. One of my big beefs is that people are being lead to belive that anything that they feel is remotely diffrent should be slapped. If I write a story about Zombies, or if I play a D&amp;D game set in a 'school' - should I be cuffed in front of my peers and hauled off to jail?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There has to be some common sense applied. It's like the people who think that if you read Harry Potter you are a Satanist. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We cannot react to all threats equally - there has to be some triage going on. A bomb threat does not equal a short story about zombies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heh - sorry - rant mode off ;)]]></wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From <a href="http://www.unhappybirthday.com/">Unhappy Birthday</a><br /><blockquote> "Did you know Happy Birthday is copyrighted and the copyright is currently owned and actively enforced by Time Warner?<br /><br />Did you know that if you sing any copyrighted song:<br />...at a place open to the public<br />...or among a substantial number of people who are not family or friends<br />You are involved in a public performance of that work?<br /><br />Did you know an unauthorized public performance is a form of copyright infringement?"</blockquote><br /><br />You know, I had often wondered why many major chains (such as <a href = http://www.applebees.com/>Applebees) do not use the 'traditional' words. I had heard rumors before that the song was copyrighted, but I had never tracked down the reality of story. Enter <a href = http://mako.yukidoke.org/copyrighteous/projects/20050301-00.html>Mako</a>, your freindly neighboorhood anarchist. <br /><br />So, the moral of this story is this - If you sing Happy Birthday to your freind or family member in a public place, you can be sued for copyright infringement? Check out <a href = http://www.unhappybirthday.com/>Unhappy Birthday for the full scoop, and methods of turning in your freinds, foes and random people for this shocking crime!</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>(Read the full <a href=http://www.theonion.com/news/index.php?issue=4110>article - With Pictures</a>!)<br /><br /><blockquote>Bush announces Iraq Exit Strategy: We'll go through Iran<br /><br /><span class="caps">WASHINGTON</span>, DC â€” Almost a year after the cessation of major combat and a month after the nation's first free democratic elections, President Bush unveiled the coalition forces' strategy for exiting Iraq.<br /><br />"I'm pleased to announce that the Department of Defense and I have formulated a plan for a speedy withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq," Bush announced Monday morning. "We'll just go through Iran."<br /><br />Bush said the U.S. Army, which deposed Iran's longtime enemy Saddam Hussein, should be welcomed with open arms by the Islamic-fundamentalist state.<br /><br />"And Iran's so nearby," Bush said. "It's only a hop, skip, and a jump to the east.<br /></blockquote><br /><br />I commend Mr. Bush's decision to announce his exit strategy from Iraq. We have needed such a strategy for quite some time, and I think that the troops in the field and the people at home will laud accolades on Mr. Bush for this announcement.<br />We have needed an efficient and quick exit strategy for quite some time, and this fits the bill. Also, I think that Iran will lend us much assistance, as they must be relived that their long time foe, Saddam is gone.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, reading more and thinking more. That is always a dangerous combination. Here is what I am thinking about right now.<br /><br />Given that the universe is at least as <a href="http://www.encyclopedia.com/html/M/Machspri.asp">holistic</a> <a href="http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/physics/pdf/0112/0112094.pdf">as</a> <a href="http://citebase.eprints.org/cgi-bin/citations?id=oai:arXiv.org:gr-qc/9812003">modern</a> physics thinks it is, perhaps even more, what can we gain by exploring smaller and smaller parts of it to more and more resolution?<br /><br />I guess that the quandary is as follows. Every part of the universe, from the smallest particle can effect every other part of the universe. We are, in fact, all in this together. By segmenting our knowledge into smaller and smaller disciplines, are we in fact doing our greater good a disservice?<br /><br />To understand a system, be it a computer system, an engine, or a biosphere - one needs a high level understanding of how all of the pieces and parts interact.<br /><br />For example - you would never take you car to a person who only knew how spark plugs worked (but knew every last little detail about spark plugs) to get it fixed would you? You would want some one who had a general understanding of the entire thing worked.<br /><br />Same goes with modern science. We have people who are so tightly focused on their specialties that they cannot see the whole picture. We have people who only think about string theory and how it works, but know little about the structure of distant stars. I would think that generalists who have a good understanding of many fields of study (but not in depth) might be needed. If for nothing more then to keep abreast of all of the developments in all of the fields and try and see where one field might benefit from others.<br /><br />After all, we have seen that what is true at the microscopic can also be true at the macroscopic.<br /><br />-Tsyko</p>]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[So true you Tsyko.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;I saw a show on something like the Discover Channel where two brothers had gone into so completely different lines of work, or so they thought.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Now this story could be completely wrong, but it went something like this...&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;One brother was an eye doctor, and one a computer scientist.  One day they were at a family gathering when the eye doctor brought up a problem with one of his patience.  They both sat discussing it and soon found themselves working together on this problem.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;You see, the brother who worked in computers brought his knowledge of how computers &quot;see&quot; and the eye doctor was able to apply this research into making his patience see once again!&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Without these two brothers getting together this breakthrough may still be unknown to us.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;I think this plays into what the Duk was saying.  By understanding a larger chunk of the universe we can unravel more of its secrets.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I think that one of the challenges is that our understanding of the universe  is at such a detailed level, that a lifetimes work can be spent on the smallest detail.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;In my humble opinion, we need to start training generalists.

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I think that both efforts are important.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;As far as training goes though, I don't know how you can properly train a generalist, or a (a term I prefer) synethesizer.  Obviously, it is easy to train someone to know a little about a lot of things, but to get something from that you need a unique mind and usually a pretty detailed knowledge of at least one thing.  Since you don't know ahead of time what disciplines will combine together to create a new synthesis training for this is tough.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Obviously you also need the backup of people who DO know a lot about all the detailed things as well, to actually make it work.  I wouldn't want my mechanic to just know about spark plugs, but I would certainly want the spark plug maker he buys them from to know EVERYTHING about spark plugs.]]></wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.wyp-ptm.org/">Physics for the Third Millennium</a><br /><br /><blockquote>In February 1998, Marshall Space Flight Center's Science Directorate hosted a Workshop/Training Conference which invited leading physicists to meet with Marshall researchers about the cutting-edge issues in the world of physics at the dawn of the new millennium. Seven lectures covered a variety of topics at the edge of knowledge.<br /><br />The Science Directorate is organizing a follow-on conference to again bring together leading physicists to participate in a series of lectures on open issues in physics in 2005. The intended audience is wider and the number of participants greater than at the 1998 meeting but the range of topics will be as exciting. We hope to bring together leaders in the fields who can discuss such topics as What is Gravity, Dark Matter and Energy, Neutrino Physics, Issues in Quantum Physics, String Theories and New Dimensions, Physics of High Energies and Temperatures, A Century of Relativity, Where Physics and Biology Meet, and others yet to be defined.<br /><br />A major feature of this meeting is the addition of a significant education component to the meeting goals and venue. We are bringing the lecturers together with students and teachers with the hope of putting a human face to the world of physics.</blockquote><br /><br />Oooooohhh. Can I go?</p>]]></content:encoded>

<title>F/OSS vs Commercial development theories</title>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href=http://www.osnews.com/editor.php?editors_id=1>Eugenia</a> posted an <a href=http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=9933>article</a> a few days ago, and then <a href=http://www.expert-zone.com/index.php?module=announce&#38;ANN_user_op=view&#38;ANN_id=750&#38;4ae6d70e6dc49027d85e12bb2dd15191=19155f6cc836bb9d8ed256cf68c4d5a9>another</a> was posted and the lists started up and another etc...<br /><br />The short and long of the entire thing is that Eugenia feels that F/OSS developers are not as open to feature requests as Commerical developers. I tend to agree with her. F/OSS developers tend to 'scratch their itches' and not mine or yours. They are not paid for their efforts after all.<br /><br />If you want a customer centeric experince, look into customer driven software. One where the developers have a vested intrest in developing for their clients. <a href=http://www.kde.org><span class="caps">KDE</span></a> and <a href=http://www.gnome.org>Gnome</a> are good examples. Many of <span class="caps">KDE</span>'s developers are employed by <a href=http://www.suse.com>SuSE</a> and <a href=http://www.novell.com>Novell</a>. Many Gnome devlopers are employed by Novell and <a href=http://www.canonical.com/>Canonical</a>.<br /><br />But, wait, those are F/OSS software, right? Right!<br /><br />Most major F/OSS projects are sponsored by large, paying companies. If you support those companies, you support those projects. You gain a more powerful voice with the project to see your goals met.<br /><br />So, the moral of the story is as follows. If you love using F/OSS software, and are happy with it, great. Support the companies that support the software, or donate.<br /><br />If some very important feature is missing, add it yourself, or support one of the companies, and tell them what you want.<br /><br />As an aside, <a href=http://www.theopencd.org/>The Open CD</a> is a good thing. Go, download it and check it out. Some really cool F/OSS software for windows there. Go - get it!<br /><br />-Tsyko</p>]]></content:encoded>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to the <a href="http://www.eds.com/services/alliances/agility/">Agility Alliance</a>, <br /><br /><blockquote>From a corporate perspective, we are not confident where Linux is right now today. A large enterprise needs to be sure because it relates to securifying [sic] the environment. We see some of the same things occurring that did to Unix <del>- it could splinter into many different types of languages. We are quite cautious about Linux and its deployment</blockquote><br /><br />and<br /><br /><blockquote>We are concerned about security on an open standard environment like that. We are also concerned about some of the scalability issues that we are seeing on our clients on a global basis. Also, we are somewhat cautious about what happened with Unix , it splintered into eight applications -</del> until McNealy (Scott McNealy, chief executive of Sun) finally announced he won the battle and had the one surviving Unix out there. We think Linux has the possibility of going the same route</blockquote><br /><br />and<br /><br /><blockquote>If you test Red Hat against Solaris 10 against whatever elseâ€¦ we would say that Solaris 10 beats it hands down on functionality and everything else</blockquote><br /><br />(all from <a href=http://www.zdnet.com.au/news/software/0,2000061733,39184795,00.htm>this</a> article ad ZDNet)<br /><br />So, these guys are saying that Linux is not scaleable, and insecure, and we should use <a href=http://www.sun.com>Sun</a>'s <a href=http://www.sun.com/software/solaris/index.jsp>Solaris</a> instead.<br /><br />I found it funny that the Members of this "<a href=http://www.eds.com/services/alliances/agility/>Agility Alliance" include <a href=http://www.sun.com>Sun</a> and <a href=http://www.microsoft.com>Microsoft</a>, both companies that would profit greatly from the demise of Linux.<br /><br />I also found it funny to find the following article just two above on <a href=http://www.osnews.com>OSNews</a>:<br /><br /><blockquote>The homegrown Linux operating system has come a long way from its origins as a college kid's pet project and computer hobbyist favorite. Refined in recent years by professional computer programmers at <span class="caps">IBM</span>, Hewlett-Packard, Novell and Red Hat, Linux now has become so technically powerful that it lays claim to a prestigious title-<a href=http://www.forbes.com/home/enterprisetech/2005/03/15/cz_dl_0315linux.html>it runs more</a> of the world's top supercomputers than any other OS.</blockquote><br /><br />Also - guys, Sun does not own Unix. There are several flavors of Unix still out there - <span class="caps">AIX</span>, HP/UX, <span class="caps">BSD</span> and (shudders) <span class="caps">SCO</span> to name a few..<br /><br />Get your facts "straightified" before you start to pop off with stuff like this. <br /><br />So - who we gonna trust? Sun and Microsoft or Forbes?<br /><br />-Tsyko</p>]]></content:encoded>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A friend and I were talking, when I brought up the topic of using Ogg files instead of <span class="caps">MP3</span>'s. As his iRiver supports Ogg, I chided him on his use of <span class="caps">MP3</span>'s.<br /><br />He asked what was wrong with <span class="caps">MP3</span>'s. I explained that the format was encumbered by patents and costs. He responded 'So?'<br /><br />So? I was at a loss for words.<br /><br />So, I decided to find out why.<br /><br />I will start with the social issues, and then wander towards the technical issues.<br /><br /><blockquote>Digital technology and network distribution has removed the middleman between the artist and the music listener, but the content industry wants to put the middleman back in place. They can do this with the help of a proprietary music format and software that they can control, with artificial restrictions to limit its potential.</blockquote><br />(From <a href=http://mondodesigno.com/music/ogg.htm>Daniel James</a>)<br /><br />It's all about the bucks. The content providers make a ton of money right now off of audio CD sales. They are not going to if the artists can interact directly with the consumers.<br /><br /><blockquote>All of the money advanced by the record company to the act has to be paid back by the act from it's small percentage of the CD returns. This percentage can be as low as 5%. Consequently, record companies are always in profit a long time before acts are, if they ever are.</blockquote><br />(From <a href=http://www.abc.net.au/arts/music/stories/s913325.htm><span class="caps">ABC</span> Australia</a>)<br /><br /><blockquote>With the advent of digital music, the content industry thinks that it can massively increase profits by eliminating the costs associated with conventional music distribution on physical media.</blockquote><br />(From <a href=http://mondodesigno.com/music/ogg.htm>Daniel James</a>)<br /><br /><blockquote>Another advantage over <span class="caps">MP3</span> is that Vorbis sounds better, and its smaller. There's two sides of that scale - either it's smaller or it sounds better. Vorbis can get a little smaller and still sound better than <span class="caps">MP3</span>, or it can get a lot smaller and still sound pretty good.</blockquote><br />(From <a href=http://mondodesigno.com/music/interview.html>Jack Moffitt</a>)<br /><br /><blockquote>I'm a music fan. Why should I be interested? <br /><br />Because Vorbis provides a high-quality format for you to listen to your music. <br />For a given file size, Vorbis sounds better than <span class="caps">MP3</span>. This means: You can keep your music collection at about the same quality level, but it'll take up less space or you can have your music collection take up about the same amount of space, but have it sound better. Vorbis already enjoys widespread player support and work is underway to play Vorbis files on portable hardware.</blockquote><br />(From <a href=http://www.vorbis.com/faq.psp#fan>Vorbis</a>)<br /><br />I am ripping at an Ogg quality of 8, and I am getting about 6 megs per song. Sammy Hagar's Heavy Metal is 6.07 megs in size. I am going to set it back down to 6.  I ripped that song at 8 and at 6, and I could not hear a difference.<br /><br /><a href=http://www.xiph.org/ogg/vorbis/listen.html>Dare to compare</a> the difference between the formats.<br /><br />-Tsyko</p>]]></content:encoded>

Try hitting the snooze bar again now!'</blockquote><br /><br />Anyone that knows me, knows that I simply have to get one. That's too cool! Imagine the possibilities - you could set traps for it (<i>If I pile the clothes like this, when it jumps off the nightstand it will get stuck</i> or <i>Well, you see the alarm clock jumps down and hits this lever which trips this fan which blows this wirlygig which turns this crank which drops this ball into this track which rolls down and moves this seesaw which pushes this rod up which dumps this bucket of water into this other bucket which swings across the room which pushes this lever which turns on the coffee machine.</i>)<br /><br /><br />-Tsyko</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4379371.stm">Let fans decide on digital rights</a><br /><br /><blockquote>The argument over the use of digital rights management (DRM) to control the distribution and use of music and other content took an interesting turn this week...<br /><br />...What Jon and his fellow programmers have done is work out exactly what information the iTunes client sends to the store, and what responses it gets back when someone buys a song and downloads it.<br /><br />Jon earned the nickname "DVD Jon" for his exploits<br />Then they have written their own program that does all of the same things with one key exception: their code does not add the FairPlay digital rights management wrapper to the downloaded music file.<br /><br />Instead of having to accept the limitations that Apple has placed on what you can do with the music you have purchased, you can use your own judgment as to what is fair and legal...<br /><br />...It is great having people like Jon around because he combines astonishing technical ability with devotion to the spirit of copyright law and the importance of "fair use" rights.<br /><br />That is, the freedom to do things like make copies for personal use, or keep backups, or just play music on any computer or portable player you happen to own.<br /><br />For him, the purpose of PyMusique is not to encourage people to break copyright law but to point out how technology is being used to take away freedoms that we should be fighting to preserve.  </blockquote><br /><br />I agree with what the article says. Apple's 'FairPlay', and indeed any <span class="caps">DRM</span> scheme is destined for failure. Why should I buy a tune from Apple, when I cannot play it on my iRiver? When I cannot use my Linux box to play it on my Home Stereo?<br /><br /><blockquote>here is a simple solution for those who, like me, disagree with Apple's approach to selling music online and that is not to buy any.<br /><br />I do not buy locked-down music, so I will not buy songs from iTunes or anywhere else that limits what I can do with them.<br /><br />Instead, I use sites like <a href="http://www.betterpropaganda.com/">betterPropaganda</a>, which have indie artists and unlocked files.<br /><br />But most of the time I simply buy CDs and rip them to my hard drive.<br /><br />I get the artwork, I get a high quality copy of the music that I can re-copy at any time if I should lose my digital version, and I get a music file I can play on any device I choose, now or in the future.</blockquote><br /><br />That's what I do. I do not share my <a href="http://tsykoduk.blogspot.com/2005/03/gimme-my-ogg.html">Ogg</a> files with folks that do not own the CD, and I only play them in my truck, or on my home system, or when <span class="caps">I DJ</span> Raves.<br /><br />Just kidding about that last one.<br /><br />Or am I?<br /><br />-Tsyko</p>]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I been been interested in the digital rights/copywrite debate for a long time now.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;My conclusion, provisionally at least, is that we may need to abandon the concept of 'fair use'.  I am not entirely happy about this, but technological changes have always resulted in changes in copywrite law, and I think this might be a needed rememedy.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;I think that there would be less anger if the concept that you were purchasing use of a song on a particular machine, rather than purchasing the song itself, and that  it would go along way to solve a lot of these issues.  &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Now, whether the price for a song on a single machine should still be a buck or if it should be less as a result is a different issue.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Well, if I can buy a CD that I can use in any CD Player for 15 bucks, and it has 10 - 15 songs on it (about an hour's music) the asking .99 for a song that I can only play with one application on one computer is pretty poor.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;I think that we need to keep the idea of fair use. If I pay money for something, then I should be able to use it, no?&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;I guess I just feel that when I buy a thing, that I should have ownership of that thing. If that thing is a copyable thing, and the license that I buy it under says that I am not to give it to others, then I do not give it to others. If I do, I should be held accountable under the law.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;I am not saying that Apple is Evil for selling their songs like this, just that I will not buy them. If I had all windows and Apple at home, this would not be such an issue.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;So, I still buy CD's, I rip them onto my harddrive and use them that way. I guess that it's just personal choice now.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;What I do not look forward to is a day when we &quot;abandon the concept of 'fair use'&quot;. If CD's are no longer sold, I will have to bow to the mass media and get the songs from iTunes, or Wallmart online or what ever. But you can bet that I will be working at removing the DRM wrappers so that I can enjoy them on my Linux boxes, my Home Stereo and in my Truck...]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Assuming you could purchase single machine downloads for all the machines you desire to have the music on (yes a big assumption) there is obviously a price point at which you would prefer cheaper, multiple downloads to a single multi-use download.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;If for example you could download a song to 5 machines for 10 cents each, or download a multi-use version for a dollar, most people would probably pich the single use downloads.  Fairly quickly I expecet that the multi-use services would disappear for lack of a sufficient audience.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;I expect also that the companies would make a whole lot more money off of 10 cents per download per machine than they do from the current 1 dollar per song.  Not because people have more than 10 machines, but because they would download a lot more songs, more frequently.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Or, I can pay $15 for a physical CD, rip it,  play it anywhere, anytime, &lt;B&gt;and&lt;/B&gt; have a physical backup that will last 20 some odd years.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;I agree that at a certian price point it will work - Heck, iTunes is at most folks price point right now. That is one rocking service.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;I guess that I am not trying to convince people to not use it - just be aware of the licensing restrictions.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;That is what it comes down to with Any IP/DRM/License. Be aware of what you are buying. I feel that people should have the freedom to use any licensing scheme that they want for their creative work. However, they should also respect the licenses of the IP that they use in their works.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;So if Band A or Record Label A wants to release all of their music via DRM that restricts their use to only the Purple iPods, great! I will not buy it, but that should be their choice.]]></wp:comment_content>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I, <i><em>_</i><i>_</em></i><i><em>_</i><i>_</em></i>_ (fill in the blank), being of sound mind and body, unequivocally declare that in the event of a catastrophic injury, I do not wish to be kept alive indefinitely by artificial means. I hereby instruct my loved ones and relatives to remove all life-support systems, once it has been determined that my brain is longer functioning in a cognizant realm. However, that judgment should be made only after thorough consultation with medical experts; i.e., individuals who actually have been trained, educated and certified as doctors.<br /><br />Under no circumstances <del>- and I can't state this too strongly -</del> should my fate be put in the hands of peckerwood politicians who couldn't pass ninth-grade biology if their lives depended on it. Furthermore, it is my firm hope that, when the time comes, any discussion about terminating my medical treatment should remain private and confidential.<br /><br />Living in Florida, however, I am acutely aware that the legislative and executive branches of state government are fond of meddling in family matters, and have little concern for the privacy and dignity of individuals.<br /><br />Therefore, I wish to make my views on this subject as clear and unambiguous as possible. Recognizing that some politicians seem cerebrally challenged themselves (and with no medical excuse), I'll try to keep this simple and to the point:<br /><br />1. While remaining sensitive to the feelings of loved ones who might cling to hope for my recovery, let me state that if a reasonable amount of time passes  <del>- say, <em>__</em> (fill in the blank) months -</del> and I fail to sit sit up and ask for a cold beer, it should be presumed that I won't ever get better. When such a determination is reached, I hereby instruct my spouse, children and attending physicians to pull the plug, reel in the tubes and call it a day.<br /><br />2. Under no circumstances shall the members of the Legislature enact a special law to keep me on life-support machinery. It is my wish that these boneheads mind their own damn business, and pay attention instead to the health, education and future of the millions of Floridians who aren't in a permanent coma.<br /><br />3. Under no circumstances shall the governor of Florida butt into this case and order my doctors to put a feeding tube down my throat or through a hole into my abdomen to keep me alive. I don't care how many fundamentalist votes he's trying to scrounge for his run for the presidency in 2008, it is my wish that he plays politics with someone else's life and leaves me to die in peace.<br /><br />4. I couldn't care less if a hundred religious zealots send e-mails to legislators in which they pretend to care about me. I don't know these people, and I certainly haven't authorized them to preach and crusade on my behalf. They should mind their own business, too.<br /><br />5. It is my heartfelt wish to expire quietly and without a public spectacle. This is obviously impossible once elected officials become involved. So, while recognizing the wrenching emotions that attend the prolonged death of a loved one, I hereby instruct my relatives to settle all disagreements about my care in private or in the courts, as provided by law. If any of my family goes against my wishes and turns my case into a political cause, I hereby promise to come back from the grave and make his or her existence a living Hell.<br /><br />Hat Tip <a href=http://sharpmarbles.stufftoread.com/archive/2005/03/31/2820.aspx>Sharp as a Marble</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In an very good peice on Taxes, <a href="http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/tribune-review/opinion/columnists/will/s_318862.html">George F. Will</a> says<br /><br /><blockquote><br />The power to tax involves, as Chief Justice John Marshall said, the power to destroy. So does the power of tax reform, which is one reason why Rep. John Linder, a Georgia Republican, has a 133-page bill to replace 55,000 pages of tax rules.<br /><br />His bill would abolish the <span class="caps">IRS</span> and the many billions of tax forms it sends out and receives. He would erase the federal income tax system <del>- personal and corporate income taxes, the regressive payroll tax and self-employment tax, capital gains, gift and estate taxes, the alternative minimum tax and the earned income tax credit -</del> and replace all that with a 23 percent national sales tax on personal consumption...<br /><br />..Today the percentage of taxpayers who rely on professional tax preparers is at an all-time high. The 67 percent of tax filers who do not itemize may think they avoid compliance costs, which include nagging uncertainty about whether one has properly complied with a tax code about the meaning of which experts differ. But everyone pays the cost of the tax system's vast drag on the economy.<br /><br />Linder says Americans spend 7 billion hours a year filling out <span class="caps">IRS</span> forms and at least that much calculating the tax implications of business decisions. Economic growth suffers because corporate boards waste huge amounts of time on such calculations rather than making economically rational allocations of resources...<br /><br />...Corporations do not pay payroll and income taxes and compliance costs, they collect them from consumers through prices. So the 23 percent consumption tax would allow taxpayers to stop paying the huge embedded cost of corporate taxation.<br /><br />Linder says the director of the Congressional Budget Office told him it costs individuals and businesses about $500 billion to remit $2 trillion to Washington. And studies show that it costs the average small business $724 to collect and remit $100...<br /><br />...Furthermore, by ending payroll and corporate taxes, America would become the only nation selling goods with no tax component <del>- such as Europe's value added tax -</del> in their prices. With no taxes on capital and labor, multinationals would, Linder thinks, stampede to locate here, which would be an incentive for other nations to emulate America. "This," Linder says, "would unleash freedom around the globe."<br /><br />Critics argue that ending the income tax, with its deductibility of charitable contributions, would depress giving. Piffle, Linder says. In 1980, when the top personal income tax rate was 70 percent, a huge incentive for giving, individual charitable contributions were $40.7 billion. In 1986 the top rate was reduced to 28 percent and by 1988 charitable giving was $86.7 billion. The lesson, says Linder, is that we give more money when we have more money. </blockquote><br /><br />This is something that I have been railing about for years now. I think this is a great idea! The more money you put into consumer's hands, the more they are going to spend. Or, more importantly, save. A stronger savings will allow more Venture Capital to fund more of what the US is so good at - ideas. <br /><br />Hat Tip <a href=davejustus.blogspot.com>Dave</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Check <a href=http://www.buddhanet.net/flash/rahula/rahula.html>This</a> out...<br /><br />It's simple lessons like this that we need to learn. Often when I am wrapped up in my life and my problems, I am like Leo - not wanting to help, not thinking before acting. By training myself to be mindful, I can learn to float above the feelings that are generated in daily life. I still experience them, I still feel them, but they no longer dictate my actions. I am not ruled by my gut, but rather by my reason. I react not out of momentary passion, but out of thoughtfulness.<br /><br />-Tsyko</p>]]></content:encoded>

<blockquote>Odin's Raven writes "Opera Software's R-and-D department today announced the discovery of a new technology dubbed 'Opera SoundWave' - a platform-independent speech solution for short- and medium-range interpersonal communication. Based on open standards, Opera's patent-pending <span class="caps">P2P</span> speech technology uses analogue signals carried through open air, enabling users to communicate in real- time without the use of computers or mobile phones. Details (including link to tech preview) are available in their press release. I wonder how long it will be before a <span class="caps">FOSS</span> implementation of this technology emerges?"</blockquote>

	<p>Wow. that sounds really cool. I think that it could totally change the world, the way that we communicate and everything else. I think this is going to be big...</p>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From <a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1781171,00.asp">Eweek</a></p>


<blockquote>A pair of newly discovered security flaws in Microsoft's Internet Explorer and Outlook programs could put millions of users at risk of code execution attacks, a private research outfit warned Thursday.</blockquote>

	<p>This is part for the course - we expect there to be serious security flaws in Microsoft products.</p>


<blockquote>Marc Maiffret, chief hacking officer at eEye, said the flaws were rated "high-severity" because malicious hackers could run a successful exploit from anywhere on the Internet.

	<p>"These are client-side vulnerabilities that could allow attacks via a Web browser or the Outlook client. The risk of a zero-day attack is quite high," Maiffret said in an interview with eWEEK.com.</p>


	<p>He said Microsoft was alerted to the first vulnerability March 16. </blockquote></p>


	<p>March 16th? That's 16 days ago? Must be a biggie!</p>


<blockquote>A spokeswoman for the software giant confirmed that engineers at the Microsoft Security Research Center were investigating the eEye discoveries.

	<p>"At this time, Microsoft is not aware of any malicious attacks attempting to exploit the reported vulnerabilities, and there is no customer impact based on this issue," she said.</p>


	<p>Once the investigation is done, she said Microsoft would "take the appropriate action" to protect affected users.</blockquote></p>


	<p>They are <i>investigating</i>? What? 16 days and no patch?</p>


	<p>Microsoft is in serious trouble. To properly secure their OS, they need to re-write it from the ground up. But they cannot take the time to do that, as there are other OS's breathing down their neck. If they took a year off, and rewrote windows they would be two years behind (they are already at least a year behind Apple and the <span class="caps">FOSS</span> community). So they are stuck - keep developing Longhorn - keep slashing features from it and trying to shore up the issues that they already see coming, or drop it, and re-write the whole shebang. They have already basically lost the war in the web server market - Apache rules there with an iron fist. They are taking heat on the browser side, with Firefox and Opera starting to make serious inroads. Open Office is sniffing around at their flanks. Things are starting to look grim for the Faithful in Redmond.</p>


	<p>But, perhaps this is not as it looks at first. Taking into account that Bill <a href="http://aroundcny.com/technofile/texts/tec091999.html">said he was going to give his money away</a>, perhaps this is just a plot. If Microsoft were to fail, he could walk away with a hefty sum of money and claim that he kept his word!</p>


	<p>Conspiracy theory's aside, the technical challenges faced by Microsoft are immense. The choices that they are faced with are really tough - keep the old, or develop the new? My guess is that they stay the course.</p>]]></content:encoded>

	<p>The popular Astronomoy Picture of the Day page has photographic proof of water on mars. It will be a little difficult for those of you who don't have a degree on geology to spot the evidence, but with a little effort, I think you'll be able to make it out.</p>

<title>Open Office 2 Pre-Review</title>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, I have been using <span class="caps">RC1</span> of Open Office 2 for a few weeks now, and I just wanted to take some time to jot down some opinions.</p>


	<p>The interface is much cleaner then the 1.x era of Open Office. I must say that I really like it. The buttons are sharp and clean, and colorful. In the menus, they display the button icons next to the command, so it makes finding things easier.</p>


	<p>As far as stability, I have had no crashes with it at all. Considering this is a beta release, I am very happy with that. Still available is the <span class="caps">PDF</span> creator. The font wizard is pretty cool as well, allowing you to download and install <span class="caps">LGPL</span> fonts directly into Open Office.</p>


	<p>It seems to do a better job of importing and exporting from the Microsoft Office file formats then the older version. Excel to Open office is still lacking , only in the artistic area. I like using drop shadows when I create forms in spreadsheets. Open office does not yet support that. It's a little feature, but one that I am looking forward to.</p>


	<pre><code>I currently am running it on Windows XP SP2. Due to some of the <a href="http://software.newsforge.com/software/05/03/22/204244.shtml?tid=93">core features</a> being implemented in Java, however, getting it onto a Linux box might entail some work (installing the Java Runtime and then the Open Office package by hand), but that is work that I am going to do as soon as the full 2.o is out.</code></pre>]]></content:encoded>

<title>Feds Hack Wireless Network in 3 Minutes</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://hardware.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/04/05/1428250&#038;from=rss">From Slashdot..</a></p>


<blockquote>from the still-can't-balance-budget dept.
xs3 writes At a recent <span class="caps">ISSA</span> (Information Systems Security Association) meeting in Los Angeles, a team of <span class="caps">FBI</span> agents demonstrated current <span class="caps">WEP</span>-cracking techniques and broke a 128 bit <span class="caps">WEP</span> key in about three minutes. Special Agent Geoff Bickers ran the Powerpoint presentation and explained the attack, while the other agents (who did not want to be named or photographed) did the dirty work of sniffing wireless traffic and breaking the <span class="caps">WEP</span> keys. <a href="http://www.tomsnetworking.com/Sections-article111.php">This article</a> will be a general overview of the procedures used by the <span class="caps">FBI</span> team.</blockquote>

	<p>And people think that I am paranoid for running a firewall between my Wireless and Wired LANs.</p>


	<p>Next step for me is <span class="caps">IPSEC</span>/VPN thru the firewall for access from my laptop. I will have it set up so that I can access my files and printers from anywhere with an internet connection. But first I have to re-wire the house.. :)</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Seattle Times: Local News:<a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2002230443_webtaxhike04.html">The  Senators propose multiyear, 15-cent gas tax hike</a>
<blockquote><span class="caps">OLYMPIA: </span> Senate transportation leaders today proposed a 15 cent per gallon increase in the state gasoline tax, to be slowly phased in over the next 12 years.</blockquote>
Um.. Wow – we already pay $.28 a gallon in taxes on fuel, and now they want to tack on another $.15? Thats $.43 a gallon in taxes alone.

More then likely, the answer is not new and higher taxes, but rather a re-allocation of existing funds.

<a href="http://dor.wa.gov/Docs/Pubs/ExciseTax/FilTaxReturn/MajorTaxes.htm">Washington State took in $752,000,000</a> in Fuel Tax in ‘03. Assuming that everything stays the same, they want us to pay out $1,150,000,000 in fuel taxes!
<blockquote>The plan also includes a gross-weight fee on cars, sports utility vehicles and small trucks, as well as local-option tax increases for cities and counties.</blockquote>
So our tabs are on the way up as well. What happened to the Flat Tabs?

This is just getting silly. Higher and more complex taxes do not engender a stronger economy – they weaken it. We need to take the message to Olympia – No More Taxes! Spend the billions that you take in as if it were your paycheck! No more stupid spending.]]></content:encoded>

<title>More about Gas Taxes</title>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><a href="http://www.heritage.org/Research/Taxes/wm451.cfm">An Increase in the Gas Tax Would Hurt Consumers and Slow the Economy</a>
Some leaders in Congress want to increase the federal tax on gasoline by 5.45 cents per gallon, for the first year, and then index it to inflation. They would use the revenue from this tax increase to finance additional spending on highways and other transportation projects, which they say will benefit the economy. Macroeconomic analysis performed by the Center for Data Analysis at the Heritage Foundation, however, shows that increasing the gas tax would depress economic activity and the incomes of millions of Americans. It would also raise significantly less revenue than its proponents project. The President should be commended for his firm stand against raising the federal gasoline tax, and Congress would do well to abandon proposals to increase the gas tax and instead focus on spending highway dollars more efficiently, ideally by turning them back to the states.
</blockquote>

	<p>If gas taxes do not work on a federal level, how can they work at a state?</p>


<center><a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/transportation/215368_transpo10.html"><img src="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/dayart/20050310/fuel-tax-0310.gif" alt="Gas Tax History - Seattle PI" /></a></center>

	<p>Takeaway - The national average is 23.7 cents a gallon, and right now, we pay 28 cents a gallon. And they want to tack another 15 cents a gallon on top of that.</p>


	<p>Let's talk about budget.</p>


	<p>According to <a href="http://www.ofm.wa.gov/budget/highlights/assets/pdf/highlights.pdf">the State</a>  we will be paying 4.6 billion in health care costs for 1 million people. As we have 6 million residents, 1 in 6 people are getting health care from the state.</p>


	<p>Instead of spending that 4.6 <strong>billion</strong> on bandaids why not find the root of the problem? Why can 1 in 6 people not afford health care? What can we, as a community, do to help these people get the satisfaction of paying their own way?</p>


<blockquote>'There is something wrong with the priorities of a state that denies children health care.â€

-Gov. Christine Gregoire
</blockquote>

	<p>The State does not deny children health care! They State is not an insurance company, nor is it a hospital. It is a State Government. If the state wants to insure that children have health care, then it needs to generate the opportunities the children's parents need to provide good homes and basic health care for them.</p>


	<p>So, we could more then likely carve the 500 million out of health care alone that they are looking for to improve roads and build new bridges.</p>


	<p>However, I know that I am shouting into the wind. After all, <a href="http://www.bartleby.com/73/424.html">Alexander Fraser Tytler</a> said it best:</p>


<blockquote>A democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government. It can only exist until the voters discover that they can vote themselves largesse from the public treasury. From that moment on, the majority always votes for the candidates promising the most benefits from the public treasury with the result that a democracy always collapses over loose fiscal policy, always followed by a dictatorship. The average age of the world's greatest civilizations has been 200 years.

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[By knowing the risks, we can then take action to mitigate them. To few people understand the danger of government entitlements, however. Or, perhaps they do, and want everyone's but theirs cut back.

That is the largest problem with cutting the size of government and it's budget. Everyone is ok with cutting the programs that they do not care about. But some one cares about every program. So, if you cut one program, then you anger the people who cared about it. They say 'Why Us?' and run a candidate who supports the Woolly Kitten Rescue Program.

The only way to actually be fair about it is to cut them all at once. Then no one can cry foul, or prejudiced or anything else.

Who has the political balls to do that though?]]></wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is a good <a href="http://www.2cpu.com/articles/113_1.html">Home Theatre PC Guide</a> out there. What they talk about is how to build a Home Theater PC - more then  just a <a href="http://www.tivo.com">TiVO</a>. You will be able to record TV to a digital format, display photos, play your Sound Files. It is a one stop shop.</p>


	<p>I think that I am going to build one some day. I have a few old PC's that need a home :)</p>]]></content:encoded>

	<p><em><center>When chapman billies leave the street,
And drouthy neibors, neibors, meet;
As market days are wearing late,
And folk begin to tak the gate,
While we sit bousing at the nappy,
An' getting fou and unco happy,
We think na on the lang Scots miles,
The mosses, waters, slaps and stiles,
That lie between us and our hame,
Where sits our sulky, sullen dame,
Gathering her brows like gathering storm,
Nursing her wrath to keep it warm. </center></em></p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.blogger.com">Blogger</a> is having major issues.</p>


	<p>I had my blog over there for quite a while, and honestly, I liked it. It was simple, effective and all in all a good thing.</p>


	<p>But <a href="http://www.blogger.com">Blogger</a> has grown too fast. They are having serious preformance issues. The commenting system crashes. There are no ping/trackbacks. They post <em>"it's a free service, don't complain"</em>. If I could have signed up for a pay account that actually worked, I would have. I really liked their software (except the trackback issue). I hated the cronic slowness and other problems.</p>


	<p>So, I got <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>.</p>


	<p>I put the problems squarely in the lap of <a href="http://www.blogger.com">Blogger.</a> They are now <a href="http://weblog.siliconvalley.com/column/dangillmor/archives/000802.shtml">owned</a> by <a href="http://www.google.com">Google.</a> Why not add a few hundred servers? Why not charge for premium accounts, and funnel that money back into expansion?</p>


	<p>Excuses aside, they are providing a service. If they expect to keep their good name, the service needs to meet expectations. If it does not, people will not use their service.</p>


	<p>Here's to hoping that <a href="http://www.blogger.com">blogger</a> will get it together and fix their issues - they have done a lot to advance blogging, and they could become a force to be reckoned with in the blogosphere. Heres hoping that they come back in full force.</p>

<blockquote>
But you'd think one thing that opponents of ID (like myself) should invoke more often are the examples of downright shoddy design put forth by the creator of the universe. The design of the human testicles, for instance. Here we have one of the primary reproductive organs located in a sac outside of the body and very, very vulnerable to damage. Why? Because human sperm can't be produced at normal human body temperature! That doesn't seem like intelligent design to me.</blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://vodkapundit.com/archives/007746.php">Vodkapundit - Rebuild Them</a></p>


<blockquote>We visited the <span class="caps">WTC</span> site after the attacks. On the plywood barrier next to the site people wrote personal messages. One of them struck a chord with me: it defiantly said, "It's still New York."

	<p>I like the idea to rebuild the towers. Yes, almost 3000 people died that day: more than the number that died at Pearl Harbor. Rebuilding the towers says, "You can't beat us. You can't even slow us down." The enemy attacked building that were symbols. Fine. Rebuild the symbols they hate.</p>


	<p><strong>I wouldn't put anti-aircraft guns on the top floor.</p>


	<p>I would move the UN into one of the buildings.</strong></blockquote></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>(This is a repost from my old site, but it is still relevant)</p>


	<p>So, the Bush Whitehouse has announced that they are going to put 1 billion dollars into researching hydrogen fueled personal vehicles. I have issues with this. I honestly think that it is a waste of money.</p>


	<p>We have an existing infrastructure that costs billions of dollars to put in place. We have an automotive industry that is tooled around building internal combustion engines. Why would we want to spend the money to retool this entire infrastructure?</p>


	<p>There is another option out there. Modern diesel engines are very fuel efficient, and when coupled with Biodiesel fuel they are very environmentally friendly.</p>


	<p>Volkswagen makes a model of their Jetta with a 2L <a href="http://www.tdiclub.com/TDIFAQ/TDiFAQ-1.html"><span class="caps">TDI</span> (Turbo Diesel Injected</a>) engine that gets 50 mpg freeway and town. Couple that with a 14-gallon tank, and you have quite the cruising range. My <span class="caps">F250</span> gets 16 in town and 20 on the freeway - pretty good for a 7.3L V8 with 525 f/lbs of torque. <a href="http://auto.howstuffworks.com/question399.htm">Here</a> is a good page with lots of information about diesel engines, how they work and more.</p>


	<p>According to the <span class="caps">EPA</span>'s <a href="http://www.epa.gov/otaq/models/biodsl.htm">studies in 2002</a>, when you run biodiesel three of the four major regulated pollutants drop by 50%, 50% and 80% (C02, Particulate Matter and Hydrocarbons), and NOx rises by about 10%. Note that these were done in 2002 with engines built before 1997. According to the National Biodiesel Board, <span class="caps">B100</span>'s emissions are as following: HC:67%, Carbon Monoxide:48%, Particulate Matter:47%, NOx +10%, Sulfates:100%, Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons:80%, Nitrated <span class="caps">PAH</span>:90% and Ozone potential of speciated Hydrocarbons: 50%. All of this was taken from the <a href="http://www.biodiesel.org/pdf_files/emissions.pdf">National Biodiesel Board's Research</a>.</p>


	<p>A little about biodiesel. Many of the biodiesel fuels are blends with standard diesel. This is notated as B where the number is the percent of Biodiesel that is in the mix. So, B5 is 5% biodiesel and <span class="caps">B100</span> is 100% biodiesel. Biodiesel in the US tends to be made from Soybeans.</p>


	<p>Biodiesel is also supported in existing engines - you do not need to modify the engine to run it. <a href="http://www.biodiesel.org/resources/fuelfactsheets/standards_and_warranties.shtm">The National Biodiesel Board</a> has information about specific companies and if their warranties are voided by the use of Biodiesel.</p>


	<p>In Spokane you can get biodiesel at <a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps/print.adp?mapdata=OE4WNszgW9w1%252f4HWa41NWUo6bFFkGVqyKjQNv36KWZRrBKqKpEMPpiPFucMzEWkF2eHoq4d0ZRw1N5pEe77syDot8GF67lr9HjM3airn9dNMWb4Ymk9HUqhN2dB9MK9whkwYtXIQtFHldMzXte4MzR%252f9sjpyHD%252bKHlrnwuiSi4BbjMS2b3eVoPCJlm6c2rJu6H%252brmmM5iJh25cFoXYhnTlkpDBWpv5egrAWIAwkDgeGJMUWyd%252f56%252bkMA0eUUTwXOnlLcdUNPActZqLTKJntShL3TmZy1AEchb3hJXlowsImqJ5QUY97%252fpvRVUjdWEoJDlwmjSEnDVgvJYaqcrD6qcgzxrZrejrjXF7it4TOR2S%252f%252f6Q81ehbqrYNxic%252f6ok%252fM99ZBNoqDYD2yCjeYaVO5KMKVhh%252fT4oGe3C3BnSeoLvYsjTpUuBfHkIIo8rFfjSc8Omm9GwcPdbYkD3%252bvnvYYmpDy9WfpNAfQLIpXHpJomS2tfi0sAjQxdv9k88jN%252bPbMytKJM0sRNUk%253d">City Service Valcon,18826 East Appleway, Pump 2</a>. You can find a biodiesel pump near you at (again) <a href="http://www.biodiesel.org/buyingbiodiesel/retailfuelingsites/default.shtm">The National Biodiesel Board</a>.</p>


	<p>As of this writing, Biodiesel is more expensive then normal diesel, however Congress just lowered the Excise Tax on it, and as soon as that goes into effect, it will become much more competitive.</p>


	<p>So, let's all help out Mother Nature with the tools that we have right now, and not pour billions of dollars into new infrastructure. Let's use what we have now, buy diesel and pour that vegetable oil into it!</p>

The point is that anyone can eventually find your blog if your real identity is tied to it in some way. And there may be consequences.

	<p>Can you really, honestly blog privately? I would say - No.</p>


	<p>So - here is my advice. Blog safely. Consiter that this is not a private journal. Anyone in the world can read this. They can track down your IP address, and ask your <span class="caps">ISP</span> who was using that when you posted the article. They <strong>can</strong> find you.</p>


	<p>So, post like you are having a discussuion with a freind in a public place. There are things that you would not tell some one in that context. There should be things that you would not discuss on your blog.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.ncc-1776.com/tle2005/tle307-20050220-02.html">L. Neil Smith says:</a>
<blockquote>For those uninitiated in the ways of libertarians, the acronym "ZAP" stands for "Zero Aggression Principle", a slightly different term some of us have settled on lately for what the movement has long called the "Non-Aggression Principle". What it says is that nobody has any right to initiate physical force against anybody else, for any reason.</p>


	<p>Skipping over a lot of nitpicking that goes on among libertarians about formulation and implementation, what it means is that we're not pacifists. We will fight, we just won't start it. And if everybody acted that wayâ€”not starting itâ€”about 90 percent of the world's problems, give or take the occasional volcano or tsunamiâ€”would be solved. I changed the name simply because I thought that the acronym "ZAP" was a lot more dynamic and attractive than the more traditional "NAP".</p>


	<p>One of the best and, to me, most interesting features of the Zero Aggression Principle is that so many different folks arrive at it from so many different angles. I'm not sure where it came from originally. I first read of it in Ayn Rand's essays, but later heard it explained in greater detail by Robert LeFevre. Other teachers have taught it, as well.</p>


	<p>In Independence Day, Will Smith puts it in terms his character might well have learned from his mom: "Don't start nothin', won't be nothin'!"</blockquote></p>]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[My problem with this philosophy, especially as interpreted by many Libertarians lately, is that it definately goes against the idea of defending someone else.

I think that it is moral in many cases to initiate violence against someone else if they have initiated (or in some cases threatened to initiate) violence against a third party.

In addition, a I believe in a pre-emption philosophy as well.  If there is good reason to believe that someone will initiate violence against you, you have a right to do unto them first.  For example, if someone breaks into your house you don't have to wait for them to shoot at you before you shoot them.

Obviously this all becomes seriously complex in international politics, and the ignoring (at lest in my opinion) of these complexities has really turned me off to a good portion of the libertarian proponants.

One could claim that a much earlier version of this philosophy is the 'eye for an eye' from the Old Testament.  Jesus Christ of course took this to an entirely different level with 'turn the other cheek.']]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[&quot;&lt;em&gt;My problem with this philosophy, especially as interpreted by many Libertarians lately, is that it definately goes against the idea of defending someone else.&lt;/em&gt;&quot;

I do not subscribe to that view at all. I will defend myself, my family and my community. As the threat grows larger, the response should grow larger. So, if you threaten my town, the town should orginize a defense. Today, that's called a police force. If you threaten my Country, my Country should defend it's self. Today, called the military.

If I see you attacking a third party, I should assist in de-esclating the situation however I can. However, with out a clear and present indicator of the situation - using deadly force would be difficult to rationalize.

In other words, if I were to come upon two people fighting, I would try and break it up - not shoot one of them. However, if someone came into a stuffer shack and opened fire with a AK, I feel that I would be in my right to interviene with deadly force - be it a gun, a big rock, or a good stiff taunting.

So, it really depends.

The only place that we do not agree is in preemptive violence. If some one breaks into my house, I should not shoot them dead. I should take control of the situation. If they resist, and I &lt;strong&gt; am in fear&lt;/strong&gt; for my safety, or the safety of my family, the target will go down. For example, if he breaks into my house, and I catch him, I will cover him with my gun, and call the police. If he pulls a knife, then I make the obligatory joke and shoot him.

Eye for eye is a hard one. I am really torn on that one. If some one commits a heinous crime, should they be allowed to stay in this life? That is not a choice I would want to be faced with. I used to support capital punishment. I still do in some cases - however I know that two wrongs do not make a right. I need to think on this one more.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I don't think no pre-emption is quite so simple in many cases.

I agree it is certainly best to cover the bad guy with your gun and call the police.  In many cases that would be the reasonable and expected thing to do.

If though you knew that a couple of other people had recently been shot by burglers in your neighborhood, you would be much more likely to conclude a shoot first policy is better.  This would be especially true if you were in a situation where you couldn't be sure how much of an advantage you had over this unknown intruder.  The end result might be that you kill a nonviolent kid who was just holding a screwdriver instead of the gun you thought you saw but that doesn't mean your reasoning was wrong or immoral, regretable though the result would be.

The situation would further complicate if there were no police to call or the police were corrupt (a very realistic situation if one extends this analogy into the realm of international affairs.)

There are of course other situations where this philosophy does not seem to apply.  What do you do in the case where a person is going to injure themselves?  Typically most moral codes would justify 'violence' to prevent greater harm, wresting down someone who was going to jump off a building for example.  This would of course violate the Zero Agression Principle.

Again, I think you could make useful analogies to international relations with this one.

Non-Agression is a good place to start the debate from, a decent 'default position' if you will, but I don't think it can be the be all, end all of a moral code.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[&lt;em&gt;a nonviolent kid who was just holding a screwdriver instead of the gun you thought you saw&lt;/em&gt;

If I thought that I saw a gun carried by an intruder in my house, I would feel under enough threat to use deadly force.

If I saw a intruder, and did not see a gun, I would have him in my sights and issues the clichÃ©d 'Freeze!' command. If he made a aggressive move, again deadly force would be applied. If he complied, then he would be held until reinforcements arrived. With out reinforcements, i.e. living in anarchy I would ask him how he got in, and repair the breach in my security.

Again, I do not follow non-aggression. I follow not starting aggression. If needed, I will finish it however. When called upon to finish it, I will fight unfairly, use the maximum amount of force that I physically can, and try everything in my power to insure that I win.

For example, when the World Trade was hit - the first time, I think that the response should have been more aggressive then it was. I firmly believe in the velvet glove hiding the iron fist - or the walk softly and carry a machine gun thought. We should always attempt to help with out strings attached, however if we are crossed, we should hit hard and fast.

I do not see that as preemptive. Preemption in my  mind is &quot;we think group X might do Z so we take them out&quot;. That is wrong. It should be &quot;we think group X might do Z, so we heighten our vigilance in that area - if they try it, then we take immediate and effective action.&quot;]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[If someone breaks into your house they should get what's coming to them and not be surprised at it, but my perspective is different, to say the least.  I won't bore you with the details of my choice, I'll just say that I am going to give the bad guy about 2 seconds to drop to the ground upon command, and then I'm going to 10-ring him.  Anyone who breaks into your house deserves whatever they get.  Burglary is always a felony, and there are good reasons for that.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I think that the most important part of the quote is this

&lt;em&gt;it means is that we're not pacifists. We will fight, we just won't start it. And if everybody acted that wayâ€”not starting itâ€”about 90 percent of the world's problems, give or take the occasional volcano or tsunamiâ€”would be solved.&lt;/em&gt;

This is the crux of the matter to me. Not every does, or ever will follow this, but the more people that we expose to the idea, and the more that embrace it, the better.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I would agree.

However, a truely libertarian view is not one of total pacifism. Infact, the 2000 canidate (Harry Browne) espoused killing only the leaders of 'bad' countries. Leaving the infrastructure and citizenry safe. Basically regieme changes.

He also said that he expected that targeting leaders like that would open him up to such attacks.

It's late - facts might be a wee bit off, but the gist is there. :)]]></wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=43685">WorldNetDaily: Man arrested, cuffed after using $2 bills</a></p>


<blockquote>A man trying to pay a fee using $2 bills was arrested, handcuffed and taken to jail after clerks at a Best Buy store questioned the currency's legitimacy and called police.

	<p>According to an account in the Baltimore Sun, 57-year-old Mike Bolesta was shocked to find himself taken to the Baltimore County lockup in Cockeysville, Md., where he was handcuffed to a pole for three hours while the U.S. Secret Service was called to weigh in on the case.</blockquote></p>


	<p>Wow.</p>


	<p>Now, I do not fault the Best Buy employees as much as the police in this matter. After all, it seems that the average retail employee today is decidely wet behind the ears.</p>


	<p>I used to go about asking if places honored Federal Reserve Notes. I usally was told no, or got blank looks. <em>Note: Federal Reserve Notes are any legal US Cash.</em></p>


My favorite quote:
<blockquote>Commenting on the incident, Baltimore County police spokesman Bill Toohey told the Sun: "It's a sign that we're all a little nervous in the post-9/11 world."</blockquote>

	<p>From <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/local/bal-md.olesker08mar08,1,76004.column?ctrack=1&#38;cset=true">Michael Olesker</a> at the <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/">Baltmore Sun</a></p>


	<p>Um. Yeah. Talking about blowing it way out of proportion. Let's use the terrorism card to cover up our mistakes. Some guy paying with $2 bills is going to be the next World Trade pilot. Yeah.</p>


	<p>People. Calm down a notch. Check out the situation before making a choice.</p>


	<p>"Remember, though, your best weapon is between your ears and under your scalp - provided it's loaded."</p>

<title>A big win for Free Software</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://mako.yukidoke.org/copyrighteous/ip/20050410-00.html">Mako says</a></p>


<blockquote>Greg Pomerantz pointed me to this article on a recent 2nd Circuit copyright decision. The case basically disambiguated the term "owner" in 17 U.S.C. Â§117 (a). It may seem nit-picky and obscure but (AFAICT, <span class="caps">IANAL</span>, OMG) this decision has good implications for free software hackers.</blockquote>

	<p>and</p>


<blockquote>The case in question is Krause v. Titleserv Inc., 03-9303. Here is the back story: William Krause was a programmer and consultant hired by Titleserv to write a series of programs over the course of a decade. When Krause left Titleserv, he left the company the right use the software but not modify it. Using technical means that are not entirely clear from what I've read, he left the software "locked" so that the company did not have access to source code or the ability to modify the program. Evidently, the technical means were not very good ones. Titleserv managed to sidestep these restrictions and bring the software back into modifiable source form. They modified the program to keep it working a number of times and in a number of sometimes rather intrusive ways.

	<p>Second Circuit Judges Pierre Leval and Robert Katzmann sided with Titleserv. Leval said that courts should, "inquire into whether the party exercises sufficient incidents of ownership over a copy of the program to be sensibly considered the owner of the copy for purposes of Â§117(a)." Rightful possession is ownership.</blockquote></p>


	<p>Seems like a landmark case. If you have rightful possession of a program - then you own it and can freely modify it. This is huge!</p>


<blockquote>If you're really interested, here is another <a href="http://www.nixonpeabody.com/copyright_article.asp?ID=55&#38;PubType=A">article</a> and you can find the full case on Lexis and elsewhere.</blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[It is pretty obvious that if the 'owner' was the copywrite owner, not the owner of a copy this provision would be meaningless.  Generally speaking, a copywrite owner is free to make any modification he wants to a copy he owns.

However, I don't think this case has nearly as broad of an implication as they think it has.  First, I would bet that some of the lattitude given in the modifications was that this was a custom developed program for the company and not generally commercially availible.  In any copywrite dispute those factors would weigh heavily.

Second, even if this was allowed as precident for modifications to 'owned' code, I would expect it would not provide any protection for supplying code to others people for modification to their own 'owned' code (let alone unowned code.)]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I think that the big deal is that the owner of the software - not the copyright holder - was able to modify the software to better suit their needs.

This would be like someone reverse engineering and re-writing portions of Windows for their corprate use. This opens the door for a lot of things..

&quot;Mr Anderson - I see that you are using the Matrix 3.7 Printer Driver. It has been modifed to work under Linux. This is a breach of my copyright...Um...oh.. You own a Matrix 3.7 Printer. Sorry - you have the right to use a modified version. So sorry. I will just go and kill some hackers now.&quot;

Basically - this is starting to limit the onerous licenese that certain companys (from Redmond for example) force people to agree to before you can use their software.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I don't disagree that the outcome you describe would be a good thing, I just don't think this case gets us very close to that.

Basically, the fact that the program in question was developed specifically for Titleserv seems to play a big part in this case.  I don't think this will have any effect on mass market software.]]></wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>A once secret plan to build a nuclear landmine 'run' by live chickens has gone on public display for the first time at The National Archives, Kew, as part of the acclaimed Secret State Exhibition.</blockquote>

	<p>You can read the rest <a href="http://improbable.typepad.com/improbable_research_whats/2005/04/nuclear_pullet_.html">here</a>, but it boils down to this. They were going to stuff a nuclear landmine full of chickens to insure that the weapon's important parts did not get too cold and freeze up during the winter.</p>


	<p>Leave it to the human race to come up with an idea this unique.</p>


	<p>I don't know if I am amazed by our resourcefullness or sickened.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://davejustus.blogspot.com/2005/04/calm-before-storm.html">Dave</a> sez:</p>


<blockquote>In short, the more the Jihadists lose in Iraq, the more likely they are to use their rump forces to try something really crazy in America to make up for it. So let's stay the course in Iraq, but stay extra-vigilant at home.Certainly something worth thinking about. There is endless speculation into the mindset and motivations of Al-Qaida types. Some of what they do seems to make sense, other things seem to be extremely bizarre</blockquote>

	<p>I think that this almost goes with out saying. As a caged or cornered animal, I expect them to fight harder. I expect attempts at acts larger then the World Trade.</p>


	<p>The best way to keep this from happening is to keep them off balance as well as tightening security at home. If they are denied a base of operations, training areas, and the other infrastructure that it takes to run an organization that large, they will be pretty ineffective.</p>


	<p>I think that is what Bush is betting on. Keep hitting them hard - with conventional as well as unconventional forces, keep them running, and they will not have the time or energy to mount an effective attack.</p>


	<p>Long term, I do not think this will be an effective tactic. I feel that we need to start to look at the situation in a more strategic light. We need to identify the why of the matter. Why are these people so angry at us? It's not enough to say that it's just crazy people, or it's their religion - that is patently not true. There are underlying reasons - some caused by our foreign policy over the last 50 years, some caused by where these people live.</p>


	<p>To really end terrorism as it exists today, we need to fix the underlying problems. That is a very long term effort, and it's going to be a hard row to hoe. It will take a lot of introspection on our part, and apologizing for our missteps in the past. It will also take our engendering and promoting a culture of tolerance and openness.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I agree.

My belief is that if their is a single root cause of terrorism it is lack of freedom in the Arab world.  Lack of Freedom slows development, puts a ceiling on the middle class (the big recruitment ground for terrorists), makes it had to adapt to changes (globalization), and is also directly a source of propaganda as thugish regimes are forces to point the fingers elsewhere (U.S. and Israel) for their problems.

The real problem is though, even Freedom isn't a quick fix.  A lot of the things freedom will provide may take close to a generation to seep through the culture, ideology, and economic well being of the populous.

I think apologizing where it is warrented is good, but we have been equally shitty to other regions of the world and they have't spawned large terrorist movements.  The root cause isn't us.  I don't believe it is a coincidence that the least free region on earth is also the home to the most terrorists.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I think that the problems are caused by a juxtaposition of unfortunate root issues. One, certainly is our foreign policy in the area, as well as the success of our culture. Another is the wealth of the area being so great, and in the hands of so few. We can also look to the fundamentalism that pushes them on.

Any one of these stressors would not be enough to create the cesspool of violence, but when put together, the sum is greater then the parts.

We need to take ownership of our hand in the matter, where it makes sense.]]></wp:comment_content>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What are the root causes of terrorism, and what can we do about them?</p>


	<p>In an earlier article, I spoke a little about the root causes of Terrorism. I mentioned our foreign policy over the last 50 years , and I still feel that is part of the issue. However, writing about this made me want to find out what the real 'root causes' of terrorism are.</p>


	<p>This is what I have found so far:</p>


<blockquote>Those who hold to 'poverty as the root causeâ€ do so even though the data does not fit their model. Even leaving aside multimillionaire Osama bin Laden, the backgrounds of the September 11 killers indicates that they were without exception scions of privilege: all were either affluent Saudis and Egyptians, citizens of the wealthy Gulf statelets, or rich sons of Lebanon, trained in and familiar with the ways of the West â€” not exactly the victims of poverty in Muslim dictatorships.</blockquote>

	<p>From <a href="http://www.fpri.org/about/people/radu.html">Dr. Radu's</a> <a href="http://www.fpri.org/enotes/americawar.20020423.radu.futilesearchforrootcauses.html">article</a> The Futile Search for 'Root Causesâ€ of Terrorism</p>


	<p>That makes sense. They need people who can move unnoticed through our society. People who were educated at our schools and speak our language very well. You will not find that amongst the poor in most countries.</p>


<blockquote>Most terrorists are not motivated by the prospect of financial gain or the hopelessness of poverty, says economist Alan B. Krueger, least of all in the Middle East.
Only 13 percent of Palestinian suicide bombers are from impoverished families, while about a third of the Palestinian population is in poverty, according to new research by Claude Berrebi, a Princeton University graduate student.
A remarkable 57 percent of suicide bombers have some education beyond high school, compared with just 15 percent of the population of comparable age.
This evidence corroborates findings for other Middle Eastern and Latin American terrorist groups. Terrorists are drawn from society's elites, not the dispossessed. </blockquote>

	<p>From <a href="http://www.ncpa.org/iss/ter/2003/pd053003c.html">The Motivation for Terrorism</a>, by <a href="http://www.ncpa.org">National Center for Policy Analysis</a></p>


	<p>One of the things that I have often felt, is that Terrorism targeted at us is related to how we are perceived on the on the global stage. Over the last 50 years, we have been, if not the most, one of the most powerful players in the world. How have we used this power?</p>


<blockquote>According to the Pentagon's Defense Science Board, a strong correlation exists between U.S. involvement in international situations and an increase in terrorist attacks against the United States. President Clinton has also acknowledged that link. The board, however, has provided no empirical data to support its conclusion. This paper fills that gap by citing many examples of terrorist attacks on the United States in retaliation for U.S. intervention overseas. The numerous incidents cataloged suggest that the United States could reduce the chances of such devastating-<del>and potentially catastrophic</del>-terrorist attacks by adopting a policy of military restraint overseas.</blockquote>

	<p>From the <a href="http://www.cato.org/index.html">Cato Institutes's</a> Article <a href="http://www.cato.org/pubs/fpbriefs/fpb-050es.html">Does U.S. Intervention Overseas Breed Terrorism? The Historical Record</a></p>


	<p>But, what kind of policy's are we talking about?</p>


<blockquote>The U.S., having decided that an Iranian victory would not serve its interests, began supporting Iraq: measures already underway to upgrade U.S.-Iraq relations were accelerated, high-level officials exchanged visits, and in February 1982 the State Department removed Iraq from its list of states supporting international terrorism.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Iraq received massive external financial support from the Gulf states, and assistance through loan programs from the U.S. The White House and State Department pressured the Export-Import Bank to provide Iraq with financing, to enhance its credit standing and enable it to obtain loans from other international financial institutions. The U.S. Agriculture Department provided taxpayer-guaranteed loans for purchases of American commodities, to the satisfaction of U.S. grain exporters.</blockquote>

	<p>From <a href="http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/special/iraq/">The Saddam Hussein Sourcebook</a></p>


	<p>So , we propped up Saddam, gave him money and material to fight a war, and now we don't understand why the people that he brutalized dislike us? There are more and more examples of this kind of duplicity on our parts. We helped the Taliban fight the Russians, and then we get angry when they continue with their same extremist ways. We help with one hand, and strike with the other. It makes no sense.</p>


	<p>I certainly hope that our Foreign policymakers see the problems that our history has caused, and take a more open, and constructive approach in the future. We should be helping people be free, happy and safe , not funding extremists and butchers. We should be leading this world by example , not by a leash.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Certainly the fact that the terrorists are middle class shouldn't surprise anyone with any grasp of history at all.  Revolutions are always precipitated by the middle class, usually in response to hitting a 'glass ceiling' where they can rise no higher.  The poor are generally too busy surviving and lack resources to ferment a serious revolution anyway.

This bit, from the National Center for Policy Analysis you posted on is, I think the most signifigant peice of information on this question:

&quot;    * No other factor besides a lack of civil liberties -- including the literacy rate, infant mortality rate, terrain, ethnic divisions and religious fractionalization -- could predict whether people from that country were more or less likely to take part in international terrorism.

Thus economically well off countries that lack civil liberties have spawned relatively many terrorists. Poor countries with a tradition of protecting civil liberties are unlikely to spawn terrorists.&quot;

The Cato Institute paper strikes me as particularly unconvincing.  I think that it explains pretexts for an attack, but not reasons why the people became terrorists or what truly motivates them.  In addition, it treats domestic terrorist attacks and terrorist attacks fully sponsorer by foreign governments the same as Al-Qaida style terrorist groups.  Several of it's examples (the Japanese Cult plans to attack Disneyland is a biggie) seem to be a stretch to link things with our foreign policy actions.

It seems to me that they already had their answer, and then went hunting for data to support it.  That doesn't really tell us anything, except what sort of foreign policy the Cato Institute favors.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Just looking at Osama's history, the causes that he has assisted shows that it's not our culture, it's not a case of the have-nots vs the haves. It's a case of anger directly because of the heavy handed involvement that U.S. Foreign policy has become since the Cold War.

Lebanon is a perfect example.

&lt;em&gt;On May 17, 1983, an agreement was signed by the representatives of Lebanon, Israel, and the United States that provided for Israeli withdrawal. Syria declined to discuss the withdrawal of its troops, effectively stalemating further progress. Opposition to the negotiations and to U.S. support for the Gemayel regime led to a series of terrorist attacks in 1983 and 1984 on U.S. interests&lt;/em&gt;  (from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ghazi.de/history.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Lebanon's History&lt;/a&gt;)

If true or not, a lot of the perception is that the U.S. is a bully. Let's look at our actions in a different arena.

Imagine that you are a teacher, and you just moved to a new school. You hear that there are several groups of 4th and 5th graders that fight at lunchtime. Would you fight with one of the smaller groups?

That is what we have been doing in the past. We, the biggest power on the block, have been picking sides and fighting for what we 'think is right' ignoring social and cultural contexts that we simply do not understand as westerners.

Instead of promoting peaceful discourse, we have been selling weapons. Instead of trying to understand what is going on, we have been picking sides.

And we are amazed when people are angry with us?

I agree totally that peaceful societies will not breed terrorists - but how we reach that place is as important as getting there.

I support the war in Iraq - we put Saddam into power, and he was killing people right and left. We needed to clean up our mess. Other then that, we need to allow those people to work out their own problems. We need to give them support and help - not guns.]]></wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>Boosting people's sense of self-worth has become a national preoccupation. Yet surprisingly, research shows that such efforts are of little value in fostering academic progress or preventing undesirable behavior</blockquote>

	<p>From <a href="http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?chanID=sa006&#38;articleID=000CB565-F330-11BE-AD0683414B7F0000&#38;pageNumber=1&#38;catID=2">Scientific American</a></p>


	<p>The article is a good read. Our socity of pandering to everyone, even if they do not succeed is doing more harm the good. If everyone is given an award, then no one has anything to strive for. Competition is a heathly part of life. Conflict is also healthy. To remove these things from life does not teach anything, rather it removes the ablity to learn. When the children that are never challenged are presented with a real life challenge - what will they do? They will have no experince dealing with losing, or stress.</p>


	<p>We need to equip them with the tools that they need to have. They will not always win in real life. When they fail, they need to already know what that feels like. Also, if they are never challenged to suceed - they will always fail.</p>

	<p>One of the things that I most like about <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> and <a href="http://www.ubuntulinux.org/">Ubuntu</a> is my ablity to completly customize it. Nothing is hidden behind the smoke and mirrors of Redmond. I can, and have, change the <a href="http://www.gnome-look.org">complete look and feel</a> of the computer to <a href="http://www.kde-look.org">suit my personal tastes</a>.</p>


	<p>In a corprate enviroment, I think this kind of power would be greatly appreacated. For example, you can change out a few files, and have the boot up splash screen display your corprate logo, or legal warning banner - or what ever you want.</p>


	<p>Microsoft is starting to wake up, however. Their patch management has made huge strides over the last few years - and they are actually starting to consiter security as an important feature.</p>


<blockquote>The City of Munich is not the only government organisation to chose Debian. The German Foreign Office and the Office for IT Security, as well as the City of Vienna, have also opted for the free Linux distribution</blockquote>

	<p><a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> has a rock solid track record - in fact I think just about the only group with a better one is <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD.</a> It seems that folks over in Germany are starting to see that, and see that free does not equal poor quality. All in all a big win for <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian!</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

My blogs are hosted off a Gentoo box, and the only times I've rebooted it this year have been after power outages... rock solid.

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Yeah, the compiling aspect of Gentoo used to be pretty frustrating for me,  but I'm more patient now.  When I do large upgrades, I just shut down X, and do it overnight.  Almost everything gets done before I wake up that way.

I looked a bit at Arch right when it first started to pick up users, but never have tried.  Ubuntu is next on my list :)]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Ubuntu is really cool. I like debian for my servers,and Ubunutu for my desktops. I have download and read the Gentoo install docs several times. I am waiting for a slowdown at work to build a Ubuntu based desktop system. Really, the only package that I need to work with is the artwork package - re do all of the png's and other artwork there to reflect the look and feel of the corprate logo. The wireless card in my laptop was not supported under Linux when I last checked, but it's been at least 6 months. I am getting to that point that windows needs to be re-installed, so I think that I will try Ubuntu again.]]></wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>Bob Novak, writing about Terry Schiavo last month, inadvertently summed up the problem with the administration's Social Security reform strategy when he wrote, "This is not the cold, analytical debate over Social Security." Just so. If you're wondering why there's so little grass-roots support to date for the president's plan, it's because the focus has been on green-eyeshade issues such as solvency, transition costs, unfunded liabilities and rates of return. Actuaries to the barricades!</blockquote>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of my goals in life is to help remove the dependence that we as a country have on external sources of fuel. I feel that the best short term solution to this is to cut over to Biodiesel.</p>


	<p>I have had many conversations with friends, foes, family and passersby about this subject, and I have heard many pros and cons to this tactic. I will try and address some of the cons now.</p>


	<p><em>Why not Hydrogen?</em></p>


	<p>The Bush administration has invested a significant amount of capital in to Hydrogen as a replacement fuel. Long term , very long term, this might be viable. But, unless you are willing to wait 30 years, this might not be the best solution.</p>


	<p>In an earlier article that I wrote about Biodiesel, <span class="caps">I WAG</span>'ed that a hydrogen pump might cost $100,000. Well, it seems that I was wrong. Hydrogen pumps are more on the scale of $1,000,000 each. As we have 176,000 fueling stations in the country , we are looking at $176 billion just to put one pump at each station.</p>


	<p>Not only that, but Hydrogen is far less efficient then then petroleum or bio based combustion engines. Biodiesel  is on the order of 8 times more efficient then Hydrogen. The Volkswagen Jetta <span class="caps">TDI</span> has a 700 mile range, and the Toyota <span class="caps">FCHV</span> has about 180 mile range. This is because it takes so much more energy to produce hydrogen then biodiesel. Hydrogen is not an effective energy 'battery' , it's energy density is very low. For example, to get a 1000 mile range in a sedan, we would need 20 gallons of biodiesel vs  268 gallons of hydrogen.</p>


	<p>The cost of Hydrogen is steep as well. It would cost between $ 2.5 Trillion (wind power) and $25 trillion (solar power) to produce enough clean hydrogen to replace our current consumption. Algae based Biodiesel production plants would only cost about $170 billion to build. For a good comparison between different types of Low Emission Vehicles check <a href="http://www.unh.edu/p2/biodiesel/media/cars_on_different_fuels.doc">This out</a>.</p>


<blockquote>What is the energy efficiency for producing biodiesel? Based on a report by the <span class="caps">US DOE</span> and <span class="caps">USDA</span> entitled "Life Cycle Inventory of Biodiesel and Petroleum Diesel for Use in an Urban Bus"5, biodiesel produced from soy has an energy balance of 3.2:1. That means that for each unit of energy put into growing the soybeans and turning the soy oil into biodiesel, we get back 3.2 units of energy in the form of biodiesel. That works out to an energy efficiency of 320% (when only looking at fossil energy input - input from the sun, for example, is not included). The reason for the energy efficiency being greater than 100% is that the growing soybeans turn energy from the sun into chemical energy (oil). Current generation diesel engines are 43% efficient (HCCI diesel engines under development, and heavy duty diesel engines have higher efficiencies approaching 55% (better than fuel cells), but for the moment we'll just use current car-sized diesel engine technology).  That 3.2 energy balance is for biodiesel made from soybean oil - a rather inefficient crop for the purpose.  Other feedstocks such as algaes can yield substantially higher energy balances, as can using thermochemical processes for processing wastes into biofuels (such as the thermal depolymerization process pioneered by Changing World Technologies).  Such approaches can yield <span class="caps">EROI</span> values ranging from 5-10, potentially even higher.</blockquote>

	<p>From the <a href="http://www.unh.edu/p2/biodiesel/article_alge.html">University of New Hampshire's Biodiesel Site</a></p>


<blockquote>Bio-Diesel versus Petroleum Diesel
A similar study was co-sponsored by the United States Department of Energy and the <span class="caps">USDA</span>, entitled, "Life Cycle Inventory of Biodiesel and Petroleum Diesel for Use in an Urban Bus."
The study, published in May 1998, states; "Biodiesel yields 3.2 units of fuel product energy for every unit of fossil energy consumed in its life cycle." The report continues, "By contrast, Petroleum diesel's life cycle yields only 0.83 units of fuel energy per unit of fossil energy consumed." According to this analysis, the energy yield of biodiesel is (3.2/0.83) 280 percent greater than petroleum diesel fuel.</blockquote>

	<p>From <a href="http://www.mda.state.mn.us/ethanol/balance.html">The State of Minnesota.</a></p>


<blockquote>Anybody can make biodiesel. It's easy, you can make it in your kitchen <del>- and it's <span class="caps">BETTER</span> than the petro-diesel fuel the big oil companies sell you. Your diesel motor will run better and last longer on your home-made fuel, and it's much cleaner -</del> better for the environment and better for health. If you make it from used cooking oil it's not only cheap but you'll be recycling a troublesome waste product. Best of all is the <span class="caps">GREAT</span> feeling of freedom, independence and empowerment it will give you. Here's how to do it-everything you need to know.</blockquote>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Good point on hydrogen. I personally thought investment in hydrogen was simply done for appearance. It has the look of progress, but no real progress (as in applicable) will be made...not for a very long time. Who knows what will happen during those years...when you go so long with little to no progress it is very easy to forget that you have a problem to solve.

Hybrids, biodiesel, and ethanol (E85) all seem like more realistic alternatives. Totally cutting dependence on oil is a pipe dream. I've always ranted that it was probably the oil companies that owned all the patents on alternative fuel sources which is why we still rely so heavily on the gas-powered engine. I've never looked into it mind you, but I still rant about it. It just seems odd to me that we can put a rover on mars, yet motor vehicle technology doesn't ever seem to evolve.

I think it is time we put those agricultural grants to work; whether it is soy for biodiesel or corn for E85 fuel or perhaps even a V8 driven engine. We don't need to reinvent the wheel here to make a world of difference. Just a little progress would be a huge relief and a step in the right direction. It buys us more time at least.]]></wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[From <a href="http://science.slashdot.org/science/05/04/20/0040220.shtml?tid=160&#38;tid=14">Slashdot</a>:
<blockquote>Experiments at the worlds largest nuclear collider, <span class="caps">RHIC</span>, at Brookhaven National Laboratory reveal striking new features of the state of the early Universe. With RHICs enormous collision energy, the researchers can create matter that is composed of the fundamental building blocks of nature, quarks and gluons, in a state with temperatures of more than 1000 billion degrees. The Universe is believed to have been in this state in the first microsecond after the Big Bang. Later the quarks and gluons were trapped in the nuclear particles that the visible universe is composed of today. Until recently, researchers have thought that the quarks and gluons formed a gas. The latest results from <span class="caps">RHIC</span>, however, indicate that under the extreme conditions just around the phase transition from quarks and gluons to ordinary matter, the quarks and gluons behaved as a liquid - in fact an almost perfect liquid.</blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Spamroll has a good <a href="http://www.spamroll.com/blogarch/2005/04/the_apple_virus.php">article,</a> that I am going to repost here for my readers..</p>


<blockquote>The <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/04/21/apples_big_virus/">Register</a> just posted this piece on Apple <span class="caps">OS X</span>, and attempts to find a correlation between the recent proliferation of computer security issues, and Apple's exploding <span class="caps">OS X</span> platform sales.

	<p>I have touted Apple as a solution for the malware that binds us, <a href="http://www.spamroll.com/blogarch/2005/04/spyware_purveyo.php">over</a> and <a href="http://www.spamroll.com/blogarch/2005/03/how_to_really_h.php">over</a> and <a href="http://www.spamroll.com/blogarch/2005/03/spyware_legisla_1.php">over,</a> not because I am a "Mac-head," but because I bought one out of curiousity, and found it just plain works (and without all the nasties I became accustomed to with Windows).</p>


	<p>I have to agree with The Register - there is a correlation.</p>


	<p>If you are fed up, and are ready to make the jump, just click here: <a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=rWSLPQplAy0&#38;offerid=77305.10000493&#38;type=3&#38;subid=0">Apple Store</a>.</blockquote></p>


	<p>I have posted about this as well. Apples are great machines, and just about any alternate OS is going to be more secure then Windows.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://brain.mu.nu/#077597">Brain Fertilizer</a> says:</p>


<blockquote>Don't you think this anti-religious movement is getting out of hand?

	<p>So was this open season on religious belief brought on by libertarians who feel uncomfortable finding themselves under the same big tent as conservative Christians in voting for Bush, or liberals who feel they lost the 2004 election on the basis of religious values?</blockquote></p>


	<p>about this on <a href="http://michellemalkin.com/archives/002186.htm">Michelle Malkin</a>'s blog</p>


<blockquote>The Washington Times's Valerie Richardson has a story out today that wins my p.c.- hell-in-a-handbasket award:

    <span class="caps">DENVER</span>-The students in Vincent Pulciani's seventh-grade class were reciting the Pledge of Allegiance this week when they heard the voice over the intercom say something they'd never heard before, at least not during the Pledge.

	<p>Instead of "one nation, under God," the voice said, "one nation, under your belief system."</blockquote></p>


	<p>I ask this simple question:</p>


	<p>Should our children be forced to mouth phrases which could mean nothing to them? If a Wiccan child is forced to pledge allegiance to a God that they do not believe in, does that do that child any good?</p>


	<p>Would not God appreciate it more if it's heartfelt? Or, does he like to have people forced to love him?</p>


	<p>I think that some Christians are seeing that their faith is on the decline. And this scares them.</p>


<blockquote>Wicca projected to be <a href="http://www.emediawire.com/releases/2005/4/emw231351.htm">3rd largest U.S. religion</a> by 2012</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Witchcraft is growing so fast on high school and college campuses that Wiccan visionaires are rushing to establish their own schools." This is meant as a warning to Christian parents. Chas Cliftion, editor of Pomegranate: The International Journal Of Pagan Studies has a collaborating statement: "We (Pagans) are like a third world country that can't put up enough elementary schools fast enough."</blockquote>

	<p><a href="http://www.wordoftruthradio.com/articles/wohlberg.html">Steve Wohlberg</a>, <a href="http://www.endtimeinsights.com/site/v2_3/content/view/88/1/">Hour of the Witch</a></p>


	<p>People have to realize that intolerance is no longer an option. People have started to look beyond their parents faith. Faith based on guilt, and forgiveness of our personal shortcomings by some larger then life man behind the curtain falls short logically, and spiritually.</p>


	<p>Many people that I know prefer a belief structure based on personal responsibility, kindness, compassion and logic.</p>


	<p>This belief might or might not include a belief in a God or Godhead. It's not relevant. What is important is that these people are kind, compassionate people.</p>


	<p>And some would force them and their children to mouth allegance to a God that they do not believe in.</p>


	<p>America - land of the free as long as you agree with the majority?</p>]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Whose forcing anyone to say anything?
That's the irritating part.  You can say &quot;mashed potatoes&quot; at the &quot;under God&quot; part, or say nothing, or not say a single word of the pledge.
But if you take out the words, there's no space for the people who &lt;i&gt;want&lt;/i&gt; to say them to do so.

It's a very low-grade offensive, to be sure.  But people actually said, &quot;Merry &lt;i&gt;Christmas&lt;/i&gt;&quot; and &quot;Happy &lt;i&gt;Easter&lt;/i&gt;&quot; when I was a kid.  We had &lt;i&gt;Christmas&lt;/i&gt; trees, the main Christmas season television special included quotations from the Bible (The Peanuts Christmas special), nativity scenes were on public grounds, and there were more than few 10 Commandments on display in courthouses.  And nobody seemed to be forced to kneel or attend church under pain of death or threat of imprisonment.

The hypocrisy comes in when the people who want the 10 Commandments removed and hate the idea of a nativity scene in public view don't utter a peep about the Goddess of Justice images or Kwanza celebrations in schools.

Why not let every locality decide what's appropriate based on the prevailing belief of the local population?

There's no need to impose a personal belief on everyone else, right?

No &lt;i&gt;forced&lt;/i&gt; action/behavior/statements of belief, no establishment of religion.  It's a darn good rule of thumb.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[&quot;&lt;i&gt;people actually said, 'Merry Christmasâ€ and 'Happy Easterâ€ when I was a kid. We had Christmas trees&lt;/i&gt;&quot;

I don't know where you live, but we still have those things here in Washington State.

&quot;&lt;i&gt;Why not let every locality decide what's appropriate based on the prevailing belief of the local population?&lt;/i&gt;&quot;

That would be a good idea. So, let's get rid of the pledge as a federal 'thing' and allow states, citys, and even schools to modify it as they see fit? As the school in the article in fact, did?

So, you in fact agree with me.

&quot;&lt;i&gt;There's no need to impose a personal belief on everyone else, right?

No forced action/behavior/statements of belief, no establishment of religion. It's a darn good rule of thumb.&lt;/i&gt;&quot;

So, no religion in goverment at all. If a goverment person is religious - great. If that person wants to put the 10 commandments, or a Wiccan crede on a public building, not so great.

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Nathan,

  Feeling froggy?

  Jump on over to the Handbasket and let's really take the gloves off.  First I have a homework assignment for you.

  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.handbasket.info/index.php?name=Search&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Search&lt;/a&gt; my site with the word &quot;Pledge&quot; and read my articles on the subject before you reply.  I don't wish to waste more space covering the same ground.

Hope to see you there soon!

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The concept of 'under God' seems quite valid to me, as I think I have mentioned before.

I look at that phrase as a conditional loophole.  Basically, we pledge our loyalty toward the country conditional on it acting in a moral manner.  We acknowledge that it is 'under God' and not in and of itself the supreme authority.

Obviously some people have different views on the nature of the supreme authority.  Some call it God and believe morality derives from a Supreme being.  Some believe it is based upon 'natural law.'  While others have a belief in a multitude of Gods with varying names and sphere of responsibility.  Obviously, each of these categories has its own subdivisions as well, with a variety of names for the supreme God(ess), different interpretations of the limits of natural law and a variety of multi-thesitic pantheons.

So, I would say the the 'under your belief system of choice' is accurate to the way I think this phrase should be used.  However, it certainly does not sound very nice or roll off the tongue well.]]></wp:comment_content>

During the pledge, I can say: &quot;one nation, under Gods&quot; under my breath and no one will notice or care.  It's the thought that counts, and as a very religious, right-wing, Wiccan, I appreciate the sentiment that we live under a higher power.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[To a certain extent, I &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; agree with you.  Not to the extent you are going, though.

In places where the Goddess of Justice's image has been for scores of years, atheists will not suffer an image of the 10 Commandments.

I certainly agree that many Christians aren't that tolerant of other religions.  That doesn't excuse ahteists being hyper-intolerant of Christianity.

Unless someone is forcing you to act, i.e., forcing you kneel to an icon or attend church or recite a creed, there is no establishment of religion by the government.  Enduring &lt;i&gt;expressions&lt;/i&gt; of religion is not governmental force, it's merely good manners.  Because, like it or not, we have a society and culture heavily steeped in religion in general, and Christianity in specific.  Our country may change someday.  Islam is taking over Europe...maybe Wicca will take over the US.  But this current trend of seeing a Theocrat in every churchgoer is paranoia to the extreme, and I think it will backfire.

We'll see.

In any case, no one is going to convince me that after 200 years of having references to God in all sorts of government literature, that saying &quot;Under God&quot; in the pledge is somehow suddenly an assault on religious freedom.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[&lt;em&gt;In any case, no one is going to convince me that after 200 years of having references to God in all sorts of government literature, that saying 'Under Godâ€ in the pledge is somehow suddenly an assault on religious freedom.&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;From this day forward, the millions of our school children will daily proclaim in every city and town, every village and rural schoolhouse, the dedication of our Nation and our people to the Almighty.&quot; &lt;em&gt;President Eisenhower (1954) after signing into law a bill to have &quot;under God&quot; added to the original pledge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

So, Under God was added a little less then 200 years ago. And, it's aim is pretty clear.


&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The statement that the United States is a nation 'under God' is an endorsement of religion. It is a profession of a religious belief, namely, a belief in monotheism,&quot; Rulings by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in 2002-JUN and 2003-FEB. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;...the Pledge of Allegiance presents a vision of a monotheistic Judeo-Christian country, and ignores the fact that  there a large number of Buddhist Americans who do not adhere to monotheistic beliefs.&quot; Ken Pierce of the New York law firm Cadwalader, Wickersham &amp;amp; Taft LLP.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

So, it seems that a portion of the legal system disagrees with you.

&lt;em&gt;Unless someone is forcing you to act, i.e., forcing you kneel to an icon or attend church or recite a creed, there is no establishment of religion by the government.&lt;/em&gt;

By forcing children to recite a mantra of montheistic belief, the Goverment is forcing us to pay homage to an Icon that many of us might not belive in.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Many well-meaning Christians argue that the United States was founded by Christian men on Christian principles. Although well-intentioned, such sentiment is unfounded. The men who lead the United States in its revolution against England, who wrote the Declaration of Independence and put together the Constitution were not Christians by any stretch of the imagination&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theology.edu/journal/volume2/ushistor.htm&quot;&gt;Notes on the Founding Fathers and the Separation of Church and State&lt;/a&gt;. It goes on to point out these specifics

Thomas Paine:

&lt;blockquote&gt; I do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish Church, by the Roman Church, by the Greek Church, by the Turkish Church, by the Protestant Church, nor by any church that I know of. My own mind is my own church. (Richard Emery Roberts, ed. &quot;Excerpts from The Age of Reason&quot;. Selected Writings of Thomas Paine. New York: Everbody's Vacation Publishing Co., 1945, p. 362)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thomas Jefferson:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The legitimate powers of government extend to such acts only as are injurious to others. But it does me no injury to my neighbor to say there are twenty gods or no god. It neither picks my pocket nor breaks my leg. &lt;em&gt;(Dumas Malon, Jefferson The President: First Term 1801-1805. Boston: Little Brown and Company, 1970, p. 191)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

John Adams:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As the government of the United States of America is not in any sense founded on the Christian Religion - as it has in itself no character of enmity against the laws, religion or tranquility of Musselmen, - and as the said States never have entered into any war or act of hostility against any Mehomitan nation, it is declared by the parties that no pretext arrising from religious opinions shall ever produce an interruption of the harmony existing between the two countries. &lt;em&gt;(Charles I. Bevans, ed. Treaties and Other International Agreements of the United States of America 1776-1949. Vol. 11: Philippines-United Arab Republic. Washington D.C.: Department of State Publications, 1974, p. 1072)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Benjamin Franklin:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As to Jesus of Nazareth, my Opinion of whom you particularly desire, I think the System of Morals and his Religion, as he left them to us, the best the world ever saw or is likely to see; but I apprehend it has received various corrupt changes, and I have, with most of the present Dissenters in England, some Doubts as to his divinity; tho' it is a question I do not dogmatize upon, having never studied it, and I think it needless to busy myself with it now, when I expect soon an Opportunity of knowing the Truth with less Trouble....&quot; &lt;em&gt;(Carl Van Doren. Benjamin Franklin. New York: The Viking Press, 1938, p. 777.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://davejustus.blogspot.com/">Justus for All</a> says:</p>


<blockquote>For example, hybrid cars, which even with the increased cost of oil don't make economic sense to buy. Purchasers will never realize in fuel savings the additional cost of the vehicle versus a comparable non-hybrid vehicle. Since the foundation of our economy is energy, I expect that the 'environmental savings' of a hybrid vehicle also does not equal out over it's lifetime. Hybrid cars cost more for a reason. They have extra parts and require additional steps in assembly. All of this translates pretty directly into having a higher energy cost to build and that correlates rather closely with needing more fossil fuel inputs and hence more pollution. </blockquote>

	<p>This is exactally why we need to look at the current crop of hybrids as testbeds for future techinology. When I have a choice between a Toyota Prius for 60k that gets 60mpg (1k per mpg) or a Volkswagen Jetta <span class="caps">TDI</span> for 22k that gets 50 mpg (thats .44k per mpg) which makes more sense?</p>]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Regarding Hybrid Cars - Check out the gas savings calculator at &lt;a href=&quot;www.mixedpower.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;MixedPower.com&lt;/a&gt; to see how

much you can save with a hybrid vehicle. Most people are prety surprised at how quickly you recoup the &quot;extra&quot; cost,

especially with rising gas prices.

If you are interested in Hybrid vehicles there is a lot more information there as well.

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Wow, they really have come down in price since I looked last!

Still, I prefer tried and true techology when it comes to important stuff like cars. Diesel engines can run upwards of 500k miles, and coupled with B100 biodiesel, we can produce 100% of the needed fuel in house.

But a Prius is starting to look a little better. :)]]></wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://davejustus.blogspot.com/">Justus</a> tagged me, rotten bas... um.. nice guy that he is. :)</p>


	<p>So, here are five things that people with whom I generally associate think are really cool, but that leave me cold.</p>


	<p>1) Bloated buggy code full of holes. Examples include Microsoft Office and Microsoft Windows. Windows networking is an even bigger joke. Yeah, and I am certified in Windows Networking by Microsoft. What ever. I guess the real pet peeve is consumers that choose badly made products because 'they are cool'.</p>


	<p>2) Televison. I really don't like about 99% of the Televison shows out there. I can stand several - luckly Sheila likes them as well, so I just get out the laptop when she is watching Gilmore Girls.</p>


	<p>3) Dungeons and Dragons. Ok, I am going to broadcast to the entire world what a Geek I am. I don't like D&#38;D and the entire d20 system. It stinks. It's complicated, unrealistic and archers suck. In the real world, a longbowman was quite a scary dude. He could reach out and ram a 3 foot rod of oak through you at several hundred feet. So, I am archer dude in D&#38;D. I shoot a 4th level fighter. He has on average (d10 * 4 or about 20 hp). I do an average of 4 hp per shot. Five shots later, he falls. And, just try aiming for a critical spot - say the chest or head. Give <span class="caps">GURPS</span> 4th Ed a try. Lame Name, Good Game. :)</p>


	<p>4) Fishing. I do not really enjoy fishing. It's boring. Really boring. I would prefer to play Paintball, or go bird hunting.</p>


	<p>5) And last - but not least... Confrence calls and meetings in general. I am a 'do-er' not a talker. Planning and oversite is important, but as far as just touching bases - there are better options out there. For example, forums are a great tool for keeping geographically dispersed workers communictating.</p>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hmmm - so as an archer with a 12 st, I do about a d6 of imp damage with a shortbow. So, I shoot a poor normal human (10hp) in the torso, roll a 3.5 (average) and do 3.5 * 2 for 7 points on average (range 2 - 12).

Shoot said poor sot in the head - 3.5 - 2 (skull) = 1.5 * 4 (damage mod for head) = 6 points on average (range = 0 - 16).

Don't even get me started on crossbows. Get one with a goatsfoot, and you are plinking fully armored knights w/o breaking a sweat.

Most of the D&amp;amp;D stuff that I have seen involves making the archers shoot faster rather then more accuratly or more powerfully. Historically, archers could shoot fast (English Longbowmen were known to be able to shoot the 6th arrow before the first hit the ground) but the arrows themsevles were devistating when they hit. High ROF is to overcome long range and low hit chances, not low damage.

Anyways, my .02 :)]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[You're obviously not playing with the right powergamers if you think archers are weak in D&amp;amp;D 3.5 edition.

I play in the worldwide Living Greyhawk campaign, and have seen plenty of devastating archers in my day.  The first thing is to start with a mighty composite longbow, preferrably one that can add +4 Strength bonus to each arrow.  Then you take that bow, make it magic, and add various enhancements to it.  Holy, Bane (evil outsiders), and any of the elemental enhancements are good.  Get your friendly wizard or cleric to hit your bow with Greater Magic Weapon and your arrows with Flame Arrow.  Have your bard sing to inspire courage.  Stack as much as you can on each arrow.

So at high levels you might have 1d8 (arrow) +4 (Strength bonus) +5 (Greater Magic Weapon from a cleric with a bead of karma) +4 (bard with Inspirational Boost) +2 (specialization) +2 (Greater Bracers of Archery) +1 (prayer) +2d6 (holy) +2d6 (bane) +1d6 (fire) +1d6 (cold), and you're firing 5 or 6 times a round with Rapid Shot and Haste.

The main benefit of archers is that they can always take their full attack action.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[And what level would that be at? The GURPS archer is a normal human - 25 to 50 points. If I were to throw together a 200 or 300 point archer, yeah. sick.

I guess that the issue is that at low levels (where I like to play) D&amp;amp;D is not realistic at all. Sword fights feel like beating on folks with nerf bats immersed in molassas. What do you mean that I can only swing once in 6 seconds?

Now, I am not looking for the type of realism that you can get from taking real swords out and chopping on your close freinds and foes. But I want the system to at least aproxmiate reality. If I drive a knife into some one's chest, I want them to feel a bit of pain, not loose 1 or 2 hp.

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The D&amp;amp;D hit points are obviously unrealistic, that is pretty undeniable.  Of course, most fantasy games attempt to emulate EPIC fantasy where you can chop you way through hordes of Orcs and battle Fire Breathing Dragons.

GURPS characters who try that generally end up dead from the first few orcs and never even get to see the dragon.  GURPS is more realistic in that, but I have never understood why realism is desirable in a fantasy game.

As for the 6 second thing, D&amp;amp;D has always operated from a viewpoint that about every six seconds you can conduct a serious attack.  There is a lot of feinting and parring going on that isn't rolled out.  GURPS uses one second attacks, but you have to roll every feint and parry.  I don't know that one is more 'realistic' than the other in that regard, just different prefenences.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I have taught and practiced broadsword in the past (yeah, one of those &lt;em&gt;I really did it&lt;/em&gt; guys) including Kendo (with a smattering of Kenjitsu and Akido), Fencing, and European Broadsword. I can mount more then one attack every three seconds that have a good chance of landing. I recall a sparring match where I landed a neck, chest and knee hit in the space of about 2 or 3 seconds. And I am sure not more then 'first' level.

Games with more realistic combat systems cause folks to increase their roleplaying, use real world tactics, and really pick their fights.

With proper planning and equipment, a 150-200 point group can smack a large group of Orcs and then take on a dragon. Scream and charge tactics really do not work - just like in real life.

It takes the proper GM, however. The bad guys should be played to their intellegence. Dumb, overconfident Orcs are not going to use advanced tactics, and they will break and flee when they are getting beaten.

It's just a diffrent style of play.]]></wp:comment_content>

<blockquote>Here's a rough transcript of my interaction with the cashier &#38; subsequent managers:

	<p>Chipper Teenage Cashier Girl: "May I have your phone number?"</p>


	<p>This is common enough at a lot of places. Retailers want keys to link together purchases, and can mine a lot of information on buying trends and purchase patterns if they can define a household in a granular manner. This is also the purpose behind most grocery store discount cards. For the most part, this is a fairly benign activity, requiring the voluntary cooperation of the consumer. It's also an activity that I routinely decline to participate in.</p>


	<p>Me {out of long habit}: "Nope. I don't give that out."</p>


	<p><span class="caps">CTCG</span>: "Uh...the cash register says I have to get your address for this product."</p>


	<p>Me: {knowing that satellite radio needs a subscription, and thinking this would set me up on the spot} Ok, That's G-e-e-k W-i-t-h...uh, this signs me for the subscription, right?</p>


	<p><span class="caps">CTCG</span>: "Uh, no, it's just for our records..."</p>


	<p>Me: {a slight frost creeping into my voice} "Then you don't need it."</blockquote></p>


	<p>Hmm.. here is an easier method. Find the phone number for Best Buy. Give them that one. Works great, and has the added benifit of messing with their systems.</p>


	<p>The poor, undertrained teenyboppers that work at these places do not make the rules - so just give them what they think they need and move on. :)</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>Earlier this year, when Major League Baseball questioned Congress' right to hold public hearings on steroid use in the big leagues, Government Reform Committee Chairman Tom Davis (R-Va.) and ranking minority member Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) sent back a striking response. Davis and Waxman told baseball that the committee "may at any time conduct investigations of any matter."

	<p>Any time. Any matter. And this from the congressional committee charged with curbing government excesses.</blockquote></p>


	<p>Read the rest of the article <a href="http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=3747">here</a></p>


	<p>I think this brings up a valid point. Where do we draw the line? At what point do we tell the government to stop running our lives for us.</p>


	<p>I think that we are seeing is the progression of the Christian Culture of non-personal responsibility. If your faith tells you that your transgressions will be forgiven by some guy behind the curtain, what will happen when that seeps into real life?</p>


	<p>'<em>Give your life to God</em>'</p>


	<p>People are always looking for a way to take the pressure of living life off their backs. They want to  let some one else take over for them. Often Christians tell me to 'Give my life to God'. God will make my life better - easier - less painful.</p>


	<p>I want to run my own life. I want to be ultimately responsible for my actions. If I choose a life of Evil, I do not want to be forgiven at the end, and I want the rewards of a good life to come my way.  If I do make it to heaven, or what ever, I really do not want to see folks like Hitler there, simply because he asked for forgiveness.</p>


	<p>It is easy transformation from allowing God to make choices for you to allowing the Government to make all the hard choices for you.</p>


	<p><em>You can't eat that because it's bad for you.</em></p>


	<p>Yesterday, while I was driving, I switched to <a href="http://www.newstalk590.com/main.html">590 Talk Radio </a> and heard a segment where the 'talker' was exploring the possibly of a law suit vs Sesame Street because the Cookie Monster scarred him as a child - and made him into a cookie addict. It was in jest, but the point remains. When we espouse a culture of personal un-responsibility, we loose in many ways.</p>


<blockquote>Consider your pet. Surely Fido or Mittens is immune from government scrutiny, right? Nope. San Francisco passed a new building code earlier this year-for doghouses. In case you were considering a pair of double-Ds for your schipperke, West Hollywood, Calif. is considering a law that would ban cosmetic surgery for pets. And the state of California has banned genetically modified fish in your aquarium.</blockquote>

	<p>In the end, I feel that we should be held accountable for our choices and our actions. If we choose to eat McDonald's every day, and we end up weighing in at 450+, that is our fault - not McDonald's.</p>


	<p>If we have the money, and want to pay for Cosmetic Surgery for our pet, that is our choice.</p>


	<p>Power to the People!</p>]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Ummm...where are you getting that the non-personal responsibility movement is &lt;i&gt;Christian&lt;/i&gt;?

It is a precept of Christianity that you &lt;i&gt;cannot&lt;/i&gt; live blithely and do what you want because you are going to be forgiven.  Rather, you have been given a gift of life, and you must do good things with it.  That if you love Jesus, you will show it by trying to &lt;i&gt;be&lt;/i&gt; like Him.  Of course, we cannot achieve that, and we know it, but we aren't allowed to use that as an excuse to not &lt;b&gt;try&lt;/b&gt;.

I fully agree with the growth of non-accountability, or non-personal responsibility you cite; in fact, I mention it in my last response to your last response.  But I see that among the more liberal Left, not the Christians.  It may be just a perspective thing, but to me I've always heard the &lt;i&gt;Left&lt;/i&gt; say that nothing bad that happens to you is your fault.  It's the left who supports trial lawyers and resist tort reform, because if you get hurt, there's gotta be some big company who can make you rich.  It's the left who came up with the idea of non-competitive sports with no winners or losers; doing away with D's and F's on report cards.  It's the left who tells minorities that everything bad in your life was caused by rich, white men exploiting minorities, and that it can be fixed with more entitlements and affirmative action: i.e., you don't have to try as hard because it's not your fault.

I'm sure you have your reasons for ascribing it to Christians, but I'd need to see you show your work.  &quot;Giving my life to Jesus&quot; doesn't mean I stop taking responsibility for my choices.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Well, I would give that a strict reading of the New Testament talks a lot about living a good life. However, when I was &lt;em&gt;ascribing it to Christians&lt;/em&gt; I was ascribing it to the actions of many of the Christians that I have known over the years. Now, I am never one to stereotype - but if the shoe fits, then by all means wear it.

The issue that I have with Christian philosophy is that it takes the power to 'save' oneself away from oneself and gives it to a 'higher' power. According to Christian Doctrine, I am 'damaged' by Original Sin. God cannot stand the sight of me because of the actions of my far removed ancestors. I must be 'washed in the blood' of Christ before He can even stand the sight of me. It does not matter if I am the greatest person in the world, I am doomed with out intercession by Christ.

I prefer a philosophy based on empowerment. It is selfish of me, but I want to have the power to be able to forge my own destiny. I want to, and I will, stand on my own merits. I have made my share of mistakes, and have tried my best to learn from them. If the God thing turns out to be true, then when I stand before him for Judgment, I will stand  by my life, and hold my head high. If he is truly a forgiving God, then I have nothing to worry about. If he is not, then I would rather be in Hell with the 'interesting' people :)]]></wp:comment_content>

<title>Taxes - the Real Story</title>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have been a proponent of Sales Taxes rather then income taxes at the Federal level for many years now. It just makes sense to me. Tax on what is bought and sold rather then on what money people make just seems to be a little better way to go.</p>


	<p>My feeling is if I invest some of my money wisely, and make more money back, why should I be taxed on that? I probably invested my money in some company, and they probably made something that got taxed, and they paid income taxes to their employees and capital gains taxes and pig-in-poke taxes - it's just silly.</p>


	<p>One of the arguments that I have heard is that the federal sales tax would have to be at 50 - 60%. That would be quite a burden to bear. I never though that made much sense - because that would mean that the federal government consumed 50 - 60% of the <span class="caps">GDP</span> in cash every year. Now, I know that we have a bloated government, but come on!</p>


	<p>So, I did a little math. The <a href="http://www.fms.treas.gov/mts/mts0305.txt">Federal Budget</a> listed tax income for 2004 as $1,879,783 million. The <a href="http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/us.html"><span class="caps">CIA</span> fact book</a> (a great site, by the way) listed the '03 <span class="caps">GDP</span> as $10.99 trillion. So with some simple math - in order to come up with the same amount of federal revenue, we would need to have a sales tax (GDP tax) of $0.17 on the dollar. The  $0.23 on the dollar that <a href="http://www.fairtaxvolunteer.org/smart/sketch.html">FairTax</a> proposes would garner the Fed $2,525,400 million a year.</p>


	<p>If we were to believe the nay-sayers, we would need to tax at a rate of $0.50 per dollar, giving the Fed $5,490,000 million a year. Wow. Sounds like they are for <strong>really</strong> big government to me.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>In defending the Social Security status quo, many liberal commentators take inconsistent position</blockquote>

	<p>Thus starts a good article over at the <a href="http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=3748"> Cato Institute</a> about the need for Personal Accounts in Social Security.</p>


	<p>I agree that people need to be given ownership of their monies. The goverment has proven that it cannot be trusted with that money, so let's allow folks to keep it, build it, and then spend it when they are older.</p>


	<p>Combine this with a <a href="http://www.fairtax.org">Fairtax</a> based on sales rather them income, and we have a win win situation</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My <a href="http://noctrine.blogspot.com">brother</a>, Nelson, is 'Riding for Aids'. This explains what this is all about:</p>


<blockquote>Last June I participated in the <span class="caps">AIDS</span> LifeCycle 3 as a volunteer. Over 1200 riders pedaled the 585 mile route from San Francisco to Los Angeles, raising $4.9 million dollars. I am registered as a rider for <span class="caps">AIDS</span> LifeCycle 4, and am committed to raising $2500 to participate in the ride. This money goes directly to the San Francisco <span class="caps">AIDS</span> Foundation to support people living with <span class="caps">HIV</span> and <span class="caps">AIDS</span> in the Bay Area. This foundation provides counseling, free or reduced-cost medications to individuals, public policy and advocacy, and much more.

	<p>You can find out more information about the <span class="caps">AIDS</span> LifeCycle and affiliated organizations on my fundraising website:</p>


	<p><a href="http://www.sonic.net/<sub>olofin"&gt;<em>http://www.sonic.net/</sub>olofin</em></a></p>


	<p>The site has answers to common questions, a training log, photos, and information on how to sponsor me in my ride to end <span class="caps">AIDS</span>.</p>


	<p>Donations of any size are greatly appreciated.</p>


	<p>Thank you for your support,</p>


	<p>Nelson</blockquote></p>


	<p>Lil Bro is on his way to his goal , let's all pitch in a few dollars and see if we can hit the mark!</p>


<center><a href="https://www.aidslifecycle.org/donate/5270">Make a Donation</a></center>

	<p>(This is reposted from my old site. He is on the way - he has $1,087 out of the $2,500 that he needs. If everyone tosses in a buck or two, that will put him a long way towards his goal. This is a great thing that he is doing, and Sheila and I are <strong>very</strong> proud of him.)</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A lot of world politics are just as inane and silly as the old days (well, old days for me) when I was in elementry school. It's a story of gangs of freinds, outsiders and the feelings that engenders. In my opionion we are too free to enter into treaties and keep them to long.</p>


	<p>Why? It's like this. Suppose that you are country A. You and Country B have a disagreement. B, C and D enter into a treaty orginization to 'defend themselves' in case you attack.</p>


	<p>This is all well and good so far.</p>


	<p>So, the disagreement ends. How would you feel if B, C, and D all stayed in the treaty? Would you feel safer, or less safe?</p>


	<p>Gangs tend to make people feel less safe. The normal response to a gang is to form a group of your own for "<em>self defense</em>".</p>


	<p>To bring this into foreign policy and the real world - orginizations such as <span class="caps">NATO</span> (which was formed to combat Soviet expansion) have lived their usefullness. Short term alliances are a good idea, long term freindships are a good idea. When we start collecting into groups for the express purpose of military defense or expansionism, well, that's just a bad idea.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>A vast majority of climate scientists agree that global warming is happening and that it poses a serious threat to society. They also agree that it is being caused largely by human activities that release greenhouse gases, such as burning fossil fuels in power plants and cars and deforesting the land. These highlights <del>- and the full full report -</del> lay out some common myths and misunderstandings regarding climate change.</blockquote>

	<p>Read the rest of the article at <a href="http://www.undoit.org/what_is_gb_myth.cfm">Undoit.org</a></p>


	<p>Here is a choice passage:</p>


<blockquote>Before the Industrial Revolution, the amount of <span class="caps">CO2</span> emitted from large natural sources closely matched the amount that was removed through natural processes. That balance has now been upset by human activities, which since the Industrial Revolution have put twice as much <span class="caps">CO2</span> into the atmosphere as can be readily removed by the oceans and forests. This has resulted in the accumulation of <span class="caps">CO2</span> to the highest levels in 420,000 years.</blockquote>

	<p>The highest in 420,000 years!</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>(I have not been able to get in and comment on this on Justus For All - Blogger is having issues again. So, my comment is posted here)</em></p>


	<p>On <a href="http://davejustus.blogspot.com/2005/04/new-data-show-global-warming.html#comments">Justus for All</a>, <a href="http://www.blogger.com/profile/1891511">Cube</a> says the following:</p>


<blockquote>Global warming is a problem that will solve itself.

	<p>If things get warmer and ice melts, then you are going to have longer growing seasons and more greenery.</p>


	<p>The warmer it gets the more ocean you will have also (Most oxygen is produced by the ocean, i bet the ocean also uses the most <span class="caps">C02</span>).</blockquote></p>


	<p>This is not totally untrue. The world will adjust. I guess my concern, is will the human race adjust?</p>


	<p>When that ice melts, the oceans level will rise. Our beach front properties will become more difficult to get to (being under water and all) and our inland cities will be the new beachfront meccas.</p>


	<p>Many of the current breadbaskets (the Central Valley of California for example) will no longer be able to support agribusiness. Food will become scarse. Life will suck for the surviors.</p>


	<p>I am not saying that this will happen tomorrow, or the next day - but it's in our cards unless we do take drastic action.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I think you misunderstood what I was saying.  I will try restating it.  The climate models are wrong, in regards to the CO2 trends causing global warming.

&quot;I am not saying that this will happen tomorrow, or the next day , but it's in our cards unless we do take drastic action.&quot;

I am saying that we should do nothing, because everything will balance out, because of the unexposed see sawing nature of C02.

Basically, there are two parellal models.  One modeling climate change (using the amount of C02 in the air), and one modeling ecological change in regards to climate change, which the ecologial model would change the amount of C02 in the air.

The ecological model would use the information the Climate modle produced to create it's information.  After that was done, the Climate mode could use the ecological model's info in it's model.

The amount of C02 in the atomsphere could actually see saw, but I do not think the climate models allow for that, they treat seem to treat C02 like an unchanging varablie.]]></wp:comment_content>

But the facts do not bear this up. Over the last 100 years, our C02 production has increased greatly. However, the worlds C02 scrubbing capability has shrunk - due to human intervention. If you correlate the data in the following two charts - it really becomes evident what is happening:

C02 PPM 1957 - 2000

&lt;img src=&quot;http://orca.rsmas.miami.edu/~johnc/GlobalWarming/graph3.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;

Global Temp Changes - 1880 to 2000

&lt;img src=&quot;http://orca.rsmas.miami.edu/~johnc/GlobalWarming/fig1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;

So, if we existed in a perfect world, perhaps that model of increasing C0&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production creating the scrubbing would hold up - but as we are destroying the plants that create that C02 sink - well we could be in a world of hurt sooner or later.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[&lt;em&gt; But ecologists caution that the technique could damage marine ecosystems in ways yet to be established&lt;/em&gt;

I think that the jury is still out on Iron seeding.

I am not advocating a dramitic energy cuts - rather a switch to more enviromentally freindly energy sources. It's all about solar energy - even petrochemicals are just stored solar energy. So, let's work on getting closer to the source, and using technologys that do not have the ill effects of burning petro-chemicals.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I agree the jury is out.  The ramifications though are very intriguing.  I think that human ability to control global climate would be a huge boon, global warming or not.

While I agree fully that our present warming trend is at least partially human caused, there is no particular reason to hit on the climate of the early 20th century as the 'ideal.'

It's actually all nuclear of course, even solar.

The tricky thing is though, that one thing that makes fossil fuels so useful is that they are wonderfully concentrated energy.  We can 'artificially' create this level of concentration, but that requires energy in and of itself.  This can become a viscious circle.

I have been watching recent developments in Solar Cells, and they are interesting as well, but the key to usable solar cells is cheap and efficient storage, one reason fuel cells interest me so much.  Leave aside use of fuel cells for vehicles, Solar power is only usable as a major source of electricity to power the grid if it can be stored, and I think industrial scale fuel cells may be the way to do that.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I agree - if we could safely control the climate that would have &lt;em&gt;intresting&lt;/em&gt; ramifications.

Yeah - I know that about solar. Heh. Picking nits. :)

Petro-fuels have a high energy density, that is for sure. But there are other options that are avaible for us that are as, or more energy dense then petrochemicals. Also renewable. That's important.

Historically we have not had the options that we have today. We are on the cusp of new technology and a new economy. I think that some of this is why we see so make wealthy Arabs becoming terrorists. Some of them probally see that their wealth - oil - is going to be yesterdays news soon.

Dunno - just random thoughts, on a caffine high right now :)]]></wp:comment_content>

A caffine buzz has a strange effect on my mind. Expands it. So the normal strange randomness goes kind of wild - and I get lots of ideas from WAY out of the box. Most are just that - strange. Some are good. You never know. :)]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;That only thing that chart only shows the increase of C02. It has nothing to do with the C02 scrubbing ability of the earth at all.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Very true.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The C02 scrubbing abliity could have actually increased, just not enough to cover the amount of C02 that was produced.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And, that gives us higher Green House Gas levels, increased, hotter climate, ice caps melting, and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://greg.nokes.name/?p=314&quot;&gt;Atlantic Conveyor&lt;/a&gt; breaking down. Same thing. If the scrubbing cannot keep up with the production, then we have the same exact problem.

&lt;blockquote&gt;It would seem to me that the C02 scrubbing ablitiy needs to be increased, which one of the ways to do that is increase the temperature of the earth. Like planting moss in the cities everywhere.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

That might be a tactic - however there also might be ramifactions to that as well. I think that the most simple solution is to cut the human production of green house gasses and see what happens.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Of course, if you correlate the amount of pollution in the air over the last 30 years with a chart showing the global warming, you will get the fact that lessening polution has helped cause global warming.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Really? I don't see that at all. Could you provide more data?]]></wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cool! I am a crusader now!</p>


	<p>This just in from <a href="http://brain.mu.nu/">Brain Fertilizer</a>:</p>


<blockquote>Yes, I do think there is a <a href="http://greg.nokes.name/?p=356">recently-undertaken campaign</a> against religion in America. <a href="http://www.mcgeheezone.com/weblog/index.php/weblog/categories/C12/">Here are some more indications</a> of that campaign.

	<p>As I said in the comments on the first linked post:</p>


	<p>...no one is going to convince me that after 200 years of having references to God in all sorts of government literature, that saying 'Under Godâ€ in the pledge is somehow suddenly an assault on religious freedom.</blockquote></p>


	<p>and</p>


<blockquote> I'll say it plainly: It is retribution/revenge for the failure of the homosexual movement to win same-sex marriage rights across the entire nation. They blame religion for being the motive force behind the rejection, and so are trying to eliminate the free expression of religion nationwide.</blockquote>

	<p>The second one wins the <strong><span class="caps">WTF</span></strong> of the month award. Nuff' said on that.</p>


	<p>About the first - I have been totally mis-represented.</p>


	<p>1) I am not trying to stop anyone from any religious expression - with in the law.</p>


	<p>2) I do not feel that Christianity has some 'dark agenda'. In fact, far from it. I was married in a Christian Church, and plan on sending my children to Christian schools.</p>


	<p>What I do have, is a personal belief that is not Christian. Yes, I am a non-devout Buddhist. And I have a desire to discuss Buddhism, Christianity and other  ideologies. Why? I benefit from these discussions, as they force me to learn more about me, what I belive and point out flaws in my paradigm. I do not fear discorse. I fear small minded people taking away my freedom of Religion.</p>


	<p>I do, however feel that the Goverment is not a place for Religion. I feel that the Goverment should not lift any one religion above any other. That is a personal choice - like abortion, and people should be given the rights to make those choices on their own.</p>


	<p>I think that we all should have the right to practice what ever faith that we want. That means, I do not want me or my children to be forced to mouth platitudes to a God that I might nor might not belive in. I want them to have the <strong>choice</strong> to worship as they wish.</p>


	<p>The Framers of this noble country were very specific in their thoughts and writings on this subject - and it does not support this country as a "Christian only" Country. This country is a place where freedom is the law of the land. When people impinge on that freedom - for everyone, Christians, Buddhists, Muslems, Wiccans, etc - I think that is a bad thing.</p>


	<p>How can my defending <em>your</em> freedom to worship as you want be constituted as a "<i>campaign against religion in America.</i>" and "<i> trying to eliminate the free expression of religion nationwide</i>"?</p>]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I agree with ya Duk!  As you know there are extensive writings by me on the subject of the pledge at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.handbasket.info&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;my website&lt;/a&gt;.  Just do a search on &quot;pledge&quot; and you'll find all of my points on the subject.

As far as some big attack on the Christian faith goes, I believe Christianity has outlived its hold on folks.

No longer are people afraid of the dark and scary stories of Hell and the wrath of God.

This is merely the result of a civilization that is outgrowing its superstitions.

It's sad that Christians view a decrease in faith as an attack on them.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Wait, wait, wait.
Not &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;, specifically, no.
There has been a recent trend to eliminate public expression of religion.  Prominent examples include the lawsuit to remove &quot;Under God&quot; from the Pledge, renaming the White Christmas Tree the Holiday Tree, removing publications of the 10 Commandments from courthouses, and the people complaining that President Bush citing his faith for motivation for some decisions represents the establishment of religion.
I don't blame you for any of those things, of course.  But when I spoke of them before, you objected.  So I consider you on the opposite side of this issue from me.
That's fine; we don't always have to agree.  I enjoy your discussions so much that I added you to my blogroll.
I haven't really responded much to any latest salvos because I'm busy and not in the mood to get into it...but that doesn't mean I haven't enjoyed what you have to say.
Please, don't feel accused or attacked.  It wasn't meant that way at all.  At most, &quot;identified&quot; as a worthy philosophical adversary.]]></wp:comment_content>

Oh I don't :)

What's really scary is that I am a Republican leaning Libertarian. Yes, I voted for Bush. No, I did not care that he talked about his faith - everyone should be able to do that. Where I draw the line is when the goverment crosses the line of promoting one faith over the other. The pledge is a perfect example of that. The others are non-issues in my mind.

Honestly - I do not see that trend. I see a trend to enforce the Framers thoughts on seperation of church and state (probally taken to far by some - I will admit that freely. After all there are wackos in every group). Nothing more, nothing less.

Not a problem at all - this medium sometimes does not express the emotion behind the words, and I was cackling the entire time - um.. make that giggling. Cackling makes me sound as evil as I am.

Um. Yeah. Nothing to see here, citizen, move along..]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I think we can, and should, do more to deal with Aids in Africa.  I am not sure I like this campaign however.

First off, I don't believe that poverty in Africa will be solved by foreign aid.  Getting rid of the corrupt thugs that are running their countries into the ground and promoting free trade are the things that will help Africa combat poverty.

Of course medical problems, including Aids, but especially malaria, dramatically lower productivity on that continent, creating an addional challenge.  I think there are a number of things we can do to help, and I certainly think part of the solution should come from our Government.  However, I tend to place more faith in, and prefer to support, private charities engaged in this sort of work.

While I greatly respect Bono's work in Africa, and think he is a great humanitarian, I find it somewhat distasteful for him to sign a petition asking for the U.S. to spend an additional percent of it's budget on foreign aid.  He is not a citizen of this country.  Since he has signed this petition, I think I'll sign a petition asking Ireland to spend an additional percentage of it's budget on poverty in Africa.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I signed the one for England to spend money as well - if you go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.whiteband.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this site&lt;/a&gt; you can sign all over the world! ;)

&lt;blockquote&gt;  CORRUPTION
While corruption is harmful to all governments, losing resources to corrupt leaders is particularly devastating in poor countries where ever dollar lost results in one less child in school or one less well dug to provide clean water. Approaches like America's Millennium Challenge which direct assistance to honest governments are the most effective, as is channeling assistance through private (and faith-based) relief and development agencies. For more information about fighting corruption in the poorest countries click here. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mercycorps.org/items/327&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;More&amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

(from the &lt;a href=&quot;www.one.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;One&lt;/a&gt; site.)

I do not think that this is the perfect anwser - but it's a start. Just the debt relief that they are advocating would free up billions of dollars that the poorest countries could then spend on themselves.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Mystic Rants:

&lt;i&gt;What of the poor in our own country? Do we ignore them in favor of helping another country&lt;/i&gt;

You know, I used to say that. But the poor in our country live like kings next to the poor in some other country's. We also have welfare, workfare, food stamps, and a host of other programs already in place to keep them fed.

I think that is a cop out now days. It's a way of rationalizing us keeping our wealth to our selves and not giving a hand up to our neighbors that need it.

Now, I am not talking about funding welfare for poor countries. I am talking about just leveling the playing field, allowing them to build their own infrastructure and start to provide for themselves.

I think that this a a great way to start fostering democracy across the globe.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[In re Dave:

 I don't think that the One campaign is about getting money and providing services. I think it's about raising awareness of the problems, and getting countries to start to do something about it. In other words - One.org will not be taking money, buying food and distributing it. They are spokespeople for the organizations that will do the grunt work. NGO's that are already out there, helping.

Of course I do not feel that we should raise taxes for this - nor even spend federal monies. I think that the government should lower our taxes by 1% and give us the option of having that 1% go to a charity of our choice. Note the word option.

Now, I do not think that One.org agrees with me on that issue. They want to take 1% out of the federal budget. But, since I was going to give that 1% to charity anyways, I guess it's a wash in my case, right?

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Tsycho,

I fully agree with you about the seriousness of the problem and aplaud any attempt to raise awareness.  Like you, I prefer private charities to government action however.  So I love their goals, but I am not satisfied with their methods.

I have spent a bit of time in the Philippines, and so I have seen third world poverty compared to American poverty and there is no comparison.  And most of the poor in the Philippines have a standard of living the poor in Africa can only dream about.

I would much prefer to support a group that is directly involved in helping with these issues than a group that is devoted to getting the government to spend money to deal with this.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I also think that it's this sort of dialog that will bring this problem to the level of awareness that it should be. Honestly, I don't care who or what you support - as long as you are aware of the problem and support some sort of non-head-in-the-sand approach. Many people in the US are really not aware of how serious this problem is. I really do not understand how they could be after all of the blipverts that have been done about this, but what the hay. As long as one more person is moved to act in some fashion, I think my post did it's job!

By the way - Who would you give your support to, Dave?]]></wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>We no longer fear the biological events that once demanded an explanation, yet society still cannot accept the fact that human beings are in control of their own lives and nothing more.

	<p>It seems to me that the next logical step is for people to realize that there is no supreme being guiding their lives and determining their destiny. This is already starting to happen.</blockquote></p>


	<p>Mystic goes on in his <a href="http://blog.handbasket.info/?p=153">writing</a>, but I think that this point really has it down. <strong>We</strong> are responsible for who we are, what we do, and what mark we leave on the world.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>What does Google make of Microsoft's growing animosity and paranoia? Although neither the co-founders nor <span class="caps">CEO</span> Schmidt would comment for this story, Schmidt told an audience of Internet pioneers at <span class="caps">UCLA</span> last fall, "One of the criticisms that the media makes is to compare Google to previous-generation companies. Google is trying to solve the next problem, not the last problem."</blockquote>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://emilyscraziness.blogspot.com/2005/05/couple-links.html">Emily</a> posted about <a href="http://ambivablog.typepad.com/ambivablog/2005/05/god_and_science.html">this</a> article - and I went and read it. I think that it is a good read, and recommend anyone intrested check it out.</p>


	<p>Some have accused (pointed out?) me of being an Athiest. This cannot be farther from the truth. I belive that we cannot prove nor disprove that God exists, so it's a question of Faith. The logical evidence that we have in front of us is pretty good that God cannot exist in any way that we could comprehend. So, in my personal belief, I choose to act like he does not exist.</p>


	<p>I make my choices dependant on what my internal logic and philosophy dictate. I do not rely upon an outside force to help me, guide me, nor carry any of my weight.</p>


	<p>I simply try and be the best person that I can - training my mind to reject that which is negative and foster postive thinking.</p>


	<p>The question of if we were created or not, while interesting to discuss, is as irrelevant to every day life as the question of what color your great grandmothers hair was. We are here, rest assured in that, and beyond is only speculation. To get upset when some one disagrees with you on speculative topics is the hight of sillyness, in my mind.</p>


	<p>To quote one of my favorite <a href="http://www.principiadiscordia.com/book/60.php">books:</a></p>


<blockquote><span class="caps">NONSENSE AS SALVATION</span>

	<p>The human race will begin solving it's problems on the day that it ceases taking itself so seriously.</p>


	<p>To that end, <span class="caps">POEE</span> proposes the countergame of <span class="caps">NONSENSE AS SALVATION</span>. Salvation from an ugly and barbarous existence that is the result of taking order so seriously and so seriously fearing contrary orders and disorder, that <span class="caps">GAMES</span> are taken as more important than <span class="caps">LIFE</span>; rather than taking <span class="caps">LIFE AS THE ART OF PLAYING GAMES</span>.</p>


	<p>To this end, we propose that man develop his innate love for disorder, and play with The Goddess Eris. And know that it is a joyful play, and that thereby <span class="caps">CAN BE REVOKED THE CURSE OF GREYFACE</span>.</p>


	<p>If you can master nonsense as well as you have already learned to master sense, then each will expose the other for what it is: absurdity. From that moment of illumination, a man begins to be free regardless of his surroundings. He becomes free to play order games and change them at will. He becomes free to play disorder games just for the hell of it. He becomes free to play neither or both. And as the master of his own games, he plays without fear, and therefore without frustration, and therefore with good will in his soul and love in his being.</p>


<center><em>And when men become free then mankind will be free.
May you be free of The Curse of Greyface.
May the Goddess put twinkles in your eyes.
May you have the knowledge of a sage, and the wisdom of a child.
Hail Eris.</em></center></blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>William Anderson has this to <a href="http://blog.lewrockwell.com/lewrw/archives/007992.html#more">say</a></p>


<blockquote>Cal Thomas, in a recent column, <a href="http://www.townhall.com/columnists/calthomas/ct20050502.shtml">endorses torture</a> of our "enemies," but at least he does not directly try to Christianize it... This column, however, demonstrates that Thomas's moral compass is a bit skewed. </blockquote>

	<p><a href="http://www.townhall.com/columnists/calthomas/ct20050502.shtml">Thomas </a> says in the article:</p>


<blockquote>These people are evil to the core. The only way to protect ourselves is to extract information they might have by whatever means necessary. This war won't be won (at least by our side) if we impose on ourselves restrictions that the terrorists do not impose on themselves.</blockquote>

	<p>and</p>


<blockquote>Are we not paying attention to the beheading videos? The barbarians are at the gate. In fact, they have broken down the gate. Why are we letting them in and treating them only a little more harshly than unwelcome holiday relatives?</blockquote>

	<p>I would hope that we treat the with the dignity that they deserve as human beings! Yes, they have information that we need. There are other ways to get it that do not include torture. I understand more then most that we are at war - that our enemy wants nothing less the the destruction of our very culture. And I understand that they will stop at nothing to achive their ends.</p>


	<p>Lowering our selves to their inhuman standards is not the path to take. We might defeat them using those tactics, however we will become them. And they would win in the end.</p>


	<p>We are the good guys. We need to remind ourselves of that, and act like it. We are fighting thugs and bullys - let's not slip and become what we fight!</p>


	<p>"<em>This war won't be won if we impose on ourselves restrictions that the terrorists do not impose on themselves.</em>"</p>


	<p>So - let's go all out and strap bombs onto some Marines and send them into buildings full of civilians. If we must use the Terrorist's tactics, let's not slip up and forget one. How about just carpet bombing the Gaza Strip. Oh and we cannot forget the Montana Militia - we should car bomb their Safeways and Albertsons.</p>


	<p>We <strong>must</strong> impose restrictions on ourselves that the Terrorists will not impose on themselves. To even consider not is ludicrous.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I am willing to concede to the use of torture to obtain specific information about an attack already underway when we have good reason to believe the person in question has the info we need  (the hypothetical nuke in NYC for example.)

I am also willing to discuss what is, and what is not torture.  I think it is somewhere above using harsh languange and somewhere below cutting off body parts.  Exactly where the line is, and what line we should adhere to is worthy of discussion (I think in most circumstance the line for what is torture should be higher than the line of what we do.)

Using torture as a routine method for trying to find random information strikes me as both morally reprehensible and foolish.

And as you so correctly point out, Thomas's argument is extremely stupid.  We should mold our actions based on our standards and our needs.  The morality of the enemy doesn't play into it.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Dave - In a better world, I would have to disagree with you. However, we do not live in that world. When faced with a choice between the quite possible death of millions and the rights of one bad guy, I as well would have to fall on the side of the greater good.

It's a really slippery slope however. Rationalizing evil acts to overcome a greater evil might not be the best choice except in the most extreme cases. Once one takes that first step, it's easier to do so again and again, with less and less provication.

Where do we draw that line? 3 lives? 10? 100? 1? I am very glad that I am not faced with those choices.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I certainly agree.  That is why I lean to the idea that this should remain illegal, but if someone were to do such a thing and save the millions of lives they could be pardoned.  That makes me uncomfortable as well however, in that it is profoundly unfair to put the 'man on the spot' in the position of making this judgement call themselves and then hoping they will be vindicated.  I am unsure of what a better solution would be however.]]></wp:comment_content>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>The mystical trend of our time, which shows itself particularly in the rampant growth of the so-called Theosophy and Spiritualism, is for me no more than a symptom of weakness and confusion. Since our inner experiences consist of reproductions, and combinations of sensory impressions, the concept of a soul without a body seem to me to be empty and devoid of meaning.</blockquote>

<blockquote>I have repeatedly said that in my opinion the idea of a personal God is a childlike one, but I do not share the crusading spirit of the professional atheist whose fervor is mostly due to a painful act of liberation from the fetters of religious indoctrination received in youth. I prefer an attitude of humility corresponding to the weakness of our intellectual understanding of nature and of our own being. </blockquote>

<blockquote>A man's ethical behavior should be based effectually on sympathy, education, and social ties and needs; no religious basis is necessary. Man would indeed be in a poor way if he had to be restrained by fear of punishment and hope of reward after death.</blockquote>

	<p>and</p>


<blockquote>The religion of the future will be a cosmic religion. It should transcend personal God and avoid dogma and theology. Covering both the natural and the spiritual, it should be based on a religious sense arising from the experience of all things natural and spiritual as a meaningful unity. Buddhism answers this description. If there is any religion that could cope with modern scientific needs it would be Buddhism.</blockquote>

	<p>All of these from ol' Albert Einstein himself.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<title>Red vs Blue??</title>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://davejustus.blogspot.com/2005/05/beyond-red-and-blue.html">Dave</a> has a link to an intresting political survey - here are my results:</p>


<blockquote>Upbeat

	<p>Based on your answers to the questionnaire, you most closely resemble survey respondents within the Upbeat typology group. This does not mean that you necessarily fit every group characteristic or agree with the group on all issues.</p>


	<p>Upbeats represent 11 percent of the American public, and 13 percent of registered voters.</p>


	<p>Basic Description
Upbeats express positive views about the economy, government and society. Satisfied with their own financial situation and the direction the nation is heading, these voters support George W. Bush's leadership in economic matters more than on social or foreign policy issues. Combining highly favorable views of government with equally positive views of business and the marketplace, Upbeats believe that success is in people's own hands, and that businesses make a positive contribution to society. This group also has a very favorable view of immigrants.</p>


	<p>Defining Values
Very favorable views of government performance and responsiveness defines the group, along with similarly positive outlook on the role of business in society. While most support the war in Iraq, Upbeats have mixed views on foreign policy , but most favor preemptive military action against countries that threaten the U.S. Religious, but decidedly moderate in views about social and cultural issues.</p>


	<p>Who They Are
Relatively young (26% are under 30) and well-educated, Upbeats are the second wealthiest group after Enterprisers (39% have household incomes of $75,000 or more). The highest proportion of Catholics (30%) and white mainline Protestants (28%) of all groups, although fewer than half (46%) attend church weekly. Mostly white (87%), suburban, and married, they are evenly split between men and women.</p>


	<p>Lifestyle Notes
High rate of stock ownership (42%, 2nd after Enterprisers).</p>


	<p>2004 Election
Bush 63%, Kerry 14%.</p>


	<p>Party ID
56% Independent/No Preference, 39% Republican, 5% Democrat (73% Rep/LeanRep)</p>


	<p>Media Use
Upbeats are second only to Liberals in citing the internet as their main news source (34% compared with 23% nationwide); 46% also cite newspapers. No more or less engaged in politics than the national average. </blockquote></p>]]></content:encoded>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It should be accepted by all that faith can be a good thing or a bad thing, depending upon how it is used. Also - there are too many stories of how faith has transformed lives for the positive to dismiss it out of hand.</p>


	<p>There are several ways to look at it. My personal take is that we all have abilities that we normally cannot tap. Through belief in some external entity (or what ever smoke and mirrors we wish), we can free the parts of our minds that are fettered by the cultural reality that binds us day to day.</p>


	<p>For me, it's a question of moving beyond the need for the crutch of godhead - and realizing that I have the ability to change my life for the better. I believe very strongly in personal empowerment, and there is no more empowering feeling then to be able to look at a portion of your life, good or bad, and say "I survived that, I prospered then, I learned the lessons that I needed to learn" rather then "I was to weak - I needed to be carried through that".</p>


	<p>Our culture is steeped in taking power away from the individual, and giving it to the government, the Godhead, the leaders.</p>


<blockquote>"We need laws to regulate how hot our beef is cooked until, because we might get sick if we order it wrong!"</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Lord, you said that once I decided to follow you you'd walk with me all the way, but I have noticed that during the most troublesome times in my life, there is only one set of footprints. I don't understand why when I needed you most you would leave me." The Lord replied, "My precious, precious child, I love you and would never leave you. During your times of trial and suffering when you see only one set of footprints, it was then that I carried you."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"I was only following orders!"</blockquote>

	<p>As a Culture, we need to move beyond laying the blame for our weakness at some one else's doorstep, and take responsibly for our actions, our choices and ultimately, our feelings.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>Given the forces of divisiveness and violence that have been unleashed in many parts of the world in recent years, I have been asked to explain what resources within Buddhism I draw upon as a Buddhist scholar and Dharma teacher that might help empower people in their quest for genuine peace.</blockquote>

	<p>This <a href="http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/index.php?id=7,1166,0,0,1,0">article</a> is a fantastic read, and a very good look at the ever escalating cycle of violence that we must break to bring real peace to this world.</p>


	<p>This is one of the hardest things for me. There are some situations where the use of force is very justified - for example if my Son or Wife were to be attacked with deadly force, I would not hesitate to bring deadly force to the table in an attempt to make them safe. However, this is a slippery slope. Hatred and violence do breed more of the same.</p>


	<p>This is one of the largest issues with which I wrestle as a Buddhist. There are historical examples of Buddhist sects and monks that employ violence in self defense. I think that in certain cases this is justifiable. These tactics need to be used with the utmost caution however, as it can further hatred. If anything, violence must be tempered with love and understanding.</p>


	<p>Just thinking 'out loud' :)</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><span class="caps">OLYMPIA</span>-The Department of Licensing's Personalized Plate Review Committee today dismissed a complaint against a vanity plate with the message "JOHN316."

	<p>A complaint was filed against this vanity plate in April. This complaint triggered a routine review process the department conducts whenever a complaint is received.</blockquote></p>


	<p>From the <a href="http://access.wa.gov/news/2005/May/n2005417_6164.aspx">Washington State Goverment</a></p>


	<p>Ok - I just heard this on <span class="caps">NPR</span> durning my drive in. The story is that someone saw this vanity plate and was 'offended' by it.</p>


	<p>Now, I support seperation of church and state - I do not think that it is correct to force children to mouth platitudes to a God that they might or might not belive in, but..</p>


	<p>Come on! The person that filed the complaint cannot have been serious. Having a personally choosen vanity plate that espouses a religous preference on a car cannot be seen as the state supporting any religious preference. It's the person's choice what goes on those plates. Each person has the right to worship as they see fit. It's pretty simple folks!</p>]]></content:encoded>

	<p>Hooper: <em>Who said that?</em></p>


	<p>Holden: <em>I did. Lando Calrissian is a positive role model in the realm of Science Fiction and Fantasy.</em></p>


	<p>Hooper: <em>Fuck Lando Calrissian, Uncle Tom nigger! Always some white boy has got to invoke the Holy Trilogy. Bust this. Those movies are about how the white man keeps the brother man down, even in a galaxy far, far away. Check this shit, you got cracker farm boy Luke Skywalker, Nazi poster boy, blonde hair blue eyes. And then, you got Darth Vader, blackest brother in the galaxy, Nubian god.</em></p>


	<p>Bankie: <em>What's a Nubian?</em></p>


	<p>Hooper: <em>Shut the fuck upâ€¦Now, Vader's a spiritual brother, down with the Force and all that good shit. Then this cracker, Skywalker, gets his hands on a lightsaber and decides he's going to run the fuckin' universe, gets a whole <span class="caps">KLAN</span> of whites together. And they are goina' bust up Vaders hood, the Death Star. Now what the fuck do you call that?</em></p>


	<p>Bankie: <em>Intergalactic civil war?</em></p>


	<p>Hooper: <em>Gentrification! They goina' drive out the black element to make the galaxy quote/unquote safe for white folks. And Jedi's the most insulting installment. Because Vader's beautiful black visage is sullied when he pulls off his mask to reveal a feeble, crusty, old white man. They trying to tell us that deep inside, we all want to be white!</em></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here are my results from the <a href="http://www.philosophersmag.com/bw/games/taboo.htm">Taboo Test</a>, which I discovered on <a href="http://hereticalideas.com/index.php?p=2961">Heretical Ideas</a></p>


	<p>Taboo - The Results</p>


<blockquote>Results

	<p>Your Moralising Quotient is: 0.10.</p>


	<p>Your Interference Factor is: 0.00.</p>


	<p>Your Universalising Factor is: 0.00.</p>


	<p>Are you thinking straight about morality?</p>


	<p>You see very little wrong in the actions depicted in these scenarios. However, to the extent that you do, it is a moot point how you might justify it. You don't think an action can be morally wrong if it is entirely private and no one, not even the person doing the act, is harmed by it. Yet the actions described in these scenarios at least seem to be private like this and it was specified as clearly as possible that they didn't involve harm. Possibly an argument could be made that the people undertaking these actions are harmed in some way by them. But you don't think that an action can be morally wrong solely for the reason that it harms the person undertaking it. More significantly, when asked about each scenario, in no instance did you respond that harm had resulted. Consequently, it is a puzzle why you think that any of the actions depicted here are of questionable morality.</blockquote></p>


	<p>The chicken question got me as well - but people really do need to be allowed to make their own choices.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<blockquote>He asked many times to get married. I teased, I joked, I let him dream at times. Deep inside I knew, my heart knew that I got married long time ago to someone else.</blockquote>

	<p>I know that feeling.</p>


	<p>I have been left in the dust, watching some one who I thought that I knew do what she had told me all along she would do to me.</p>


	<p>It still hurt.</p>


	<p>I am glad that it happened. With out that point in my life, I would not be who I am today.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.spokane7.com/editions/story.asp?ID=70520">7 </a> has a good story about the power of Blogs and the new media.</p>


<blockquote>The young author is identified in a tagline as "the chair of <a href="http://www.nwprogressive.org/">Permanent Defense</a>." That's the group he formed way back in junior high.</blockquote>

	<p>One of the really positive things about this New Media is that everyone can make a diffrence. It's the great equalizer.</p>


<blockquote>What drives a teen to pour his energies into politics like that? "I was worried about the direction this nation was taking and I wanted to do something about it," he says.</blockquote>

	<p>While I might not agree with his politics, I applaud him for letting his voice be heard. It's only through discourse that we can advance.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/index.php?id=7,1194,0,0,1,0">Buddhist Channel</a> has a good cross-religion article about creating sacred space in our homes.</p>


<blockquote>Creating sacred space in the everyday world is part of honoring the fact that the spiritual is part of life and that all our life is sacred.</blockquote>

	<p>I have felt this for a long time, and usally have items around the house that remind me of sacred. Ones home should be sacred space - there is no safer and more comfy place to relax.</p>]]></content:encoded>

It is probably true though, that a similar show that replaced Mohammad with Jesus would not have been shown on the BBC.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is an intresting <a href="http://www.uscatholic.org/2005/06/dietmarmieth.pdf">article</a> over at <a href="http://www.uscatholic.org/">US Catholic</a> about the biography of the New Pope. It seems that he was at one time rather progressive - and it details his change towards conservatism. A good read - and one that is rather optimistic about Pope Benedict and the future of the Church. After reading this, I have higher hopes for the direction of the Catholic Church in the next few years.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.spokane7.com/blogs/hard7/archive.asp?postID=1581">Frank</a> of Hard 7 reports this:</p>


<blockquote>Democratic honcho Paul Berendt delivered the funniest, but most impolitic, line. Dismissing the <span class="caps">GOP</span>'s attempt to cite alleged felon votes to undermine Christine Gregoire's election as governor, Berendt said, "The Republican base has always been nonunion, white, blue-collar males, and that's who the felons are in the state of Washington." After months of pummeling from the right, the gloves are off on the Democratic side as well-and someone just slipped on a pair of brass knuckles.</blockquote>

	<p>The full story is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/23/national/23governor.html">here</a>.</p>


	<p>It's these kind of attacks that are making people sick of this whole process. With as many questions about the elections in Washington State, there should have been something done by the 'winner' a long time ago. If she was so sure of her victory it would have gone a long ways towards brining this fractured voters together if she had been able to assume power with out the great black cloud that hangs over her head now.</p>


	<p>I for one, think that we should bring <a href="http://www.un.org/Depts/dpa/ead/eadhome.htm">UN Election monitors</a> in for the next gubernatorial election.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://davejustus.blogspot.com/">Dave</a> ruminates on his blog:</p>


<blockquote>    <em>Can an individual action be morally wrong if it is entirely private and no-one, not even the person doing the act, is harmed by it at all?</em>

	<p>This statement is really the meat of this survey. I answered yes here. Not doing harm is, in my mind anyway, the beginning point, not the ending of morality.</blockquote></p>


	<p>I would like to see a action that does no harm to anyone, is private, and is immoral. I personally do not feel that can exist.</p>


	<p>Morality (in my ever so humble opinion) is part culture, part personal. There is no natural law of morality that says X shall always be immoral. If you were to belive in that, then there would have to be some mechinism for acts that had never been considered before to be measured against some natural moral stick.</p>


	<p>For example, the first creature that masterbated - this was an act that have never happened before. Now, at that moment, it would have had to be decided if that act was moral or not. That takes a choice to be made. That takes some sort consciousness.</p>


	<p>Dave also says:</p>


<blockquote>    <em>Do you think that morality comes from God or some other source outside of nature, society and human judgement?</em>

	<p>I answered no here, as should be unsurprising given my previous explanations. If morality is defined as the best possible choice, than it is a thing into and of itself, so it would arrise from nature.</blockquote></p>


	<p>However, for there to be some natural law of morality - there has to be a God or God like force that adjudicates it. So these anwsers contradict each other.</p>


	<p>Morality is either decided by the culture and the people in the culture or it is given down from on high. There is no middle road here.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I gave my defintion of morality as making the best possible decision of any given choice.

Using that definition, society and/or God can perhaps offer guidance, but they do not create the morality of the decision, the morality would be intrinsic to the situation, hence, arising from nature.

We know what is, and is not moral partly through reason, and partly through the traditions of our society.  Because moral things are 'good' things, by my definition anyway, and a society that ins't on balance 'good' (correct, workable, stable) won't survive society is usually a fairly good indicator of a minimum baseline morality.

Morality is of course, using this definition somewhat situational.  As it is rooted in free will, mental capacity must also be taken into account, as well.

When I say harm is the beginning of morality, not it's end state I am of referring to actually doing good instead of simply refraining from harm.  The good samaritan parable illustrates this concept fairly well.]]></wp:comment_content>

&lt;em&gt; the morality would be intrinsic to the situation, hence, arising from nature.&lt;/em&gt;

It would not be arising from nature then - a choice is the domain of consciousness. With out consciousness there can be no choice.

As you pointed out, Choice is extremly subjective, and 'proper choice' is even harder to define. One could define a sucide bombing a 'proper choice' if one's world view was squewed the correct way.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Heh, first off one could say that the conscieousness itself is a part of nature.

However, I hold that their are finite possible choices, limited by our own knowledge and capabilities.

I don't have a great criteria for what is best, as a general rule though the choice that benefits the choser and others the most would be the best choice.  Perception of the world doesn't matter, this is real material benefits I am talking about, although certainly these benefits can be difficult at times to identify.

Unless the Suicide Bomber actually DOES get his 75 virgins his belief that he will does not matter.

Now, it is possible for a Suicide Bomber's choice to be more limited than it might appear, for example, his sucide bombing might be the proper choice if it is a case of commiting the suicide bombing and killing 20 people or not doing it resulting in 40 people being killed (a terrorist controler threatening his family and everyone he knew for example.)

Consciousness gives us the ability to choose and makes morality possible.  Good and Bad consequence, hence moral and immoral actions, though are a natural response to the choices we make.

I give wiggle room in allowing that we can never know the full consequences of our choices, but we can apply a 'reasonable' standard to our choices.  This same standard allows us to pretty well judge another moral nature, although at times it may be wrong as we have limited knowledge of other peoples capabilities and choices.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[&lt;em&gt;one could say that the conscieousness itself is a part of nature.&lt;/em&gt;

Is nature caused by consciousness, or is consciousness caused by nature?

&lt;em&gt;as a general rule though the choice that benefits the choser and others the most would be the best choice. Perception of the world doesn't matter, this is real material benefits I am talking about&lt;/em&gt;

But 'real material benfits' are not always the result of moral choices. For example, the person who returns the wallet with the $100 bill still in it, and gets no reward. No real material benifit there - but there is a karmic, spiritual and or pschyological reward. And that reward is dependant totally on the perception of the person who made the choice.

The world is percived. We even interact with the material world through perception. We cannot directly measure the real world - we have to filter it through our eyes, optic nerves and then brain. That takes several miliseconds, and when it hits the brain, the data is processed through our beliefs and past experince.

There is no possible way that perception cannot enter into any aspect of our lives. Our perception of the world rules our lives with an iron fist.

One of the first things we should do, is to start to re-program how we percive things. We we open our perceptions to the wider world, we can react to external events with more compassion.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[&lt;em&gt;I suspect that this accident&lt;/em&gt;

Ummm.. saying that it was a accident, while engendering more hope for Humanitys future, is not accurate.

&lt;blockquote&gt;acÂ·ciÂ·dent (Äƒk'sÄ­-dÉ™nt, -dÄ•nt') pronunciation
n.
         1. An unexpected and undesirable event, especially one resulting in damage or harm: car accidents on icy roads.
         2. An unforeseen incident: A series of happy accidents led to his promotion.
         3. An instance of involuntary urination or defecation in one's clothing.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While I am sure that #3 happened, I do not classify this as 'unexpected'. Perhaps unexpected by the people that this story is about - but by a reasonable human, quite expected.]]></wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>Dear Friend,

	<p>This summer, President Bush and seven other leaders from the world's wealthiest nations will gather to discuss the fate of the <strong><span class="caps">ONE</span> billion</strong> people around the world living in extreme poverty. In early July, the Group of Eight (G8) will discuss the major social, political and economic conditions that contribute to extreme poverty.&nbsp; There are historic plans in place to beat poverty in Africa and the poorest countries. This is our chance to support our leaders in making these plans a reality. Let's raise our voices as <strong><span class="caps">ONE</span> to Make Poverty History.</strong></p>

	<p>Together as <strong><span class="caps">ONE</span></strong>, we can let President Bush know Americans support the fight against global <span class="caps">AIDS</span> and poverty!</p>


	<p>On <strong>June <span class="caps">ONE</span></strong>, we will launch an unprecedented mobilization of Americans calling on President Bush to deliver a historic deal for the world's poor at the G8 Summit.&nbsp; If everyone who reads this e-mail encourages just 3 friends to join <strong><span class="caps">ONE</span></strong>, we will be well over <strong><span class="caps">ONE MILLION</span></strong> strong in time for the G8 Summit. That's <strong><span class="caps">ONE</span> </strong>million voices united behind <strong><span class="caps">ONE</span> message: Make Poverty History!</strong></p>

	<p>Judge: Parents can't teach pagan beliefs
Father appeals order in divorce decree that prevents couple from exposing son to Wicca.</p>


	<p>By Kevin Corcoran</p>


	<p>An Indianapolis father is appealing a Marion County judge's unusual order that prohibits him and his ex-wife from exposing their child to "non-mainstream religious beliefs and rituals."</p>


	<p>The parents practice Wicca, a contemporary pagan religion that emphasizes a balance in nature and reverence for the earth.</p>


	<p>Cale J. Bradford, chief judge of the Marion Superior Court, kept the unusual provision in the couple's divorce decree last year over their fierce objections, court records show. The order does not define a mainstream religion.</p>


	<p>Bradford refused to remove the provision after the 9-year-old boy's outraged parents, Thomas E. Jones Jr. and his ex-wife, Tammie U. Bristol, protested last fall.</p>


	<p>Through a court spokeswoman, Bradford said Wednesday he could not discuss the pending legal dispute.</blockquote></p>


	<p>Wow.</p>


	<p>Want to talk about freedom of religion anyone?</p>


	<p>Some people have talked about an assualt on Christianity in the US over the last few years - pagans have been under assault since, well, since Christanity came about.</p>


	<p>It should be about tolerance. Some people just do not get that.</p>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Heh.  Actually pagans have been under assault since Christianity came to power.  Before that Pagans were assaulting Christians.

I have seen divorce rulings where one parent or the other was given the right to the child's religious upbringing and the other side was barred from interfering with that.  Those are problamatic in some respects, but at least defensible.

When both parents want the same upbringing for their child I don't see the courts having any right to interfere.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I would have less of a problem with this if the parent that had custody was upset because the other parent was teaching the kid some religion that the custodian did not agree with.

When the goverment thinks that they can tell people what religion they can and cannot teach their children, as happened in this case, it really worries me.

From my research, it seems that the case is going to the state Supreme Court, and it should be overturned.

None the less, for a Judge to issue such a blantlay unconsitiutional ruling is - well - troubling.]]></wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>New Intel <span class="caps">CEO</span> Paul Otellini has flashed a level of marketing savvy unseen with his predecessor by making the unusual suggestion that consumers by Apple's Mac computers if they wish to avoid immediate security risks.

	<p>Confused? You're not alone. Otellini had attendees of a Wall Street Journal technology conference in Carlsbad, California scratching their silicon this week, as they puzzled through his pro-Mac statements. The paper recounts the episode as follows;</p>


	<pre><code>Pressed about security by (a reporter), Mr Otellini had a startling confession: He spends an hour a weekend removing spyware from his daughter's computer. And when further pressed about whether a mainstream computer user in search of immediate safety from security woes ought to buy Apple Computer Inc.'s Macintosh instead of a Wintel PC, he said, "If you want to fix it tomorrow, maybe you should buy something else."</blockquote></code></pre>


	<p>From <a href="http://www.theregister.com/2005/05/26/otellini_buy_apple/">The Register</a></p>


	<p>I think this speaks for itself.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Winn Schwartau says:</p>


<blockquote>In the coming weeks I'm going to keep a diary of an experiment my company began at 6 p.m. April 29, 2005 - an experiment predicated on the hypothesis that the WinTel platform represents the greatest violation of the basic tenets of information security and has become a national economic security risk. I do not say this lightly, and I have never been a Microsoft basher, either. I never criticize a company without a fair bit of explanation, justification and supportive evidence.

	<p>I have come to the belief that there is a much easier, more secure way to use computers. After having spent several years focusing my security work on Ma, Pa and the Corporate Clueless, I also have come to the conclusion that if I'm having such security problems, heaven help the 98% of humanity who merely want a computer for e-mail and multimedia.</blockquote></p>


	<p>Thus starts a really good <a href="http://www.networkworld.com/columnists/2005/052305schwartau.html">Story</a>  over at <a href="http://www.networkworld.com">Network World</a></p>


	<p>For me, this is not just another switcher article. I have read Winn's security column for a while, and to see him lay out why the Wintel platform is so full of holes is intresting. He also has a blog called    <a href="http://securityawareness.blogspot.com/">Ma, Pa and the Corporate Clueless</a>. Good reading</p>


	<p>So, go, read.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>Is blogging dangerous? The Christian Science Monitor hopes it might be, in a terrifying new article entitled "Teens: It's a diary. Adults: It's unsafe." The article, which oversimplifies blogs as "self-published Web pages," cites stats given by Parry Aftab of Wiredsafety.org: "Internet stalkers have killed at least four minors in the past three years, and law enforcement authorities count about 5,000 reports of attempted sexual predation over the Internet in the past year..." Compare this to the 374 Americans struck by lightning and killed between 1995-2000 (apha.confex.com, May 25, 2005), and you may relax somewhat. Sure, cyberstalkers are scary, but so is the wrath of Zeus.</blockquote>

	<p>From <a href="http://secretlair.com/index.php?/clickableculture/entry/blogs_ate_my_teenager/">Clickable Culture</a></p>


	<p>Yet another case of statistics gone wrong. It's like I said <a href="http://greg.nokes.name/?p=425">before</a>,  The media is in the business of selling papers, air time or what ever. They are not going to report things that will not sell. I agree that parents should be aware of their children's activities, but to be terrorified because they have less then a 0.00001% (5000 acts vs 297 million people in the US) of being victimised? It's more dangerous to step off the curb.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>Every year or so I like to see how Microsoft is doing in its attempt to make a desktop operating system as usable as Linux. Microsoft Windows XP, Home Edition, with Service Pack 2, is a tremendous improvement over previous Windows versions when it comes to stability and appearance, but it still has many glitches that keep it from being competitive with <span class="caps">GNU</span>/Linux for everyday users, including a tedious installation procedure, lack of productivity software included with the operating system, hardware compatibility problems, and a price so much higher than any of the Linux distributions I've tested lately that I don't feel this product is a good value for most home or small office users</blockquote>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jesster had a <a href="http://poorrolemodel.blogspot.com/2005/05/theres-good-story-in-there.html">'thing'</a> on her site this morning. This is the result. Cliched. I know. :)</p>


<hr />


	<p>Dan was fidgeting in the chair as he waited for the conference room to clear up. He had the pastries that he usually brought to the IT meetings sitting next to him. He drew a mouthful of coffee.</p>


	<p>As the 9 am meeting let out, he saw Jesster walking away with some of her people. He got up, straightened his shirt, grabbed the box of goodies and went into the room. Booting the laptop, he logged in and got his presentation ready.</p>


	<p>As soon as all of the members of the meeting arrived, the doors shut and he began.</p>


	<p>'So, in closing, we really need to move to Reiser4 for our data volumesâ€ and he sat down.</p>


	<p>Over the next half hour, the meeting droned on. It was a normal corporate knife fight over new technology implementation. He really tried to remain involved, however he simply could not.</p>


	<p>His eyes snapped open, and he looked around. Still in the meeting, and no one was looking at him. He could not believe that he had fallen asleep.</p>


	<p>'Dan, what do you think about using the Nuclear Option on the Chinese book trade?â€</p>


	<p>He focused on the questioner, a suit from the office in New York. 'Um, I guess I do not understand the question?â€</p>


	<p>'It's simple , do we deploy our tactical nuclear weapons on the border with Chile to stop the Chinese book boot leggers?â€</p>


	<p>'I am sorry, but I really have no idea what you are talking aboutâ€</p>


	<p>'What the hell? Did you just sleep through the last four hours of meeting?â€</p>


	<p>'Well, um..â€ The suit pulled out a handgun and fired it. Dan looked down at his chest, blood staining his shirt. 'Oh.. Oh.. Godâ€</p>


	<p>His eyes snapped open. His hand moved to his chest</p>


	<p><em>Thank god, it's dry. It must have just been a dream</em></p>


	<p>He scanned the room. Nothing. No one even noticed that he had been asleep. Their discussion was centered on standards for the data center. No weapons of mass destruction. Sighing with relief, he grabbed his paper coffee cup. He gasped with pain as the paper disintegrated spilling a glowing golden liquid on his hand.</p>


	<p>Screaming in pain, Dan jumped up, watching in horror as his hand started to melt away.</p>


	<p>His eyes snapped open. The conversation droned on about file system standards. Panic began to well in his hind brain as the reality of what might be happening to him sunk in.</p>


	<p>The floor shook under his feet. He looked out the window, and saw a 747 fly past.</p>


	<p>'But we're on the third floor!â€</p>


	<p>His eyes snapped open.</p>


	<p>His eyes snapped open.</p>


	<p>His eyes snapped open.</p>


	<p>The Police officer spoke into the phone, 'That's correct Captain. The only thing left was the wedding ring at the bottom of the elevator shaft.â€</p>]]></content:encoded>

<title>Move the moon?</title>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>All of this Earth moving talk had me thinking back to <a href="http://www.analy.org/">High School</a>, where we once talked about how the moon might have formed. Since it has been a few decades (centuries?) since I was in High School, I decided to take a gander at the current thinking. I found several sites - most are just the same old theory, which is quite good.</p>


<blockquote>At the time Earth formed 4.5 billion years ago, other smaller planetary bodies were also growing. One of these hit earth late in Earth's growth process, blowing out rocky debris. A fraction of that debris went into orbit around the Earth and aggregated into the moon. </blockquote>

	<p>This <a href="http://www.psi.edu/projects/moon/moon.html">theory</a> is pretty well though out. In 2001, there were some computer simulations done by the <a href="http://www.swri.org/">Southwest Research Institute</a> that showed this process working. They have posted <a href="http://63.114.151.211/release/2001/anim24n.wmv">video</a>, and <a href="http://www.swri.org/press/fig1biga.tif">pictures</a> <a href="http://www.swri.org/press/impact.htm">here</a>. <a href="http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/planetearth/moonwhack_main_000901.html">Space.com</a> has a good article on this as well.</p>


	<p>Interesting stuff.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>A conservative news outlet just released a list of the most dangerous books of the last 200 years. While some of the books (Hitler, Keynes, Marx to a lesser extent) might actually deserve the descriptor 'dangerous", some of these are ridiculous picks. Nietzsche? Kinsey? John Stuart Mill? Freud? Darwin?!? These are considered dangerous?</blockquote>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mayor West talks on The Today Show, and the Spokesman posts a <a href="http://www.spokesmanreview.com/jimwest/story.asp?ID=053105_transcript_today">transcript.</a> Good read.</p>


<blockquote>Lauer: Do you expect them to rally around you? I mean, there are many calls for your resignation.

	<p>West: I've received letters and emails. My mail and my emails are running two to one in favor of me resigning. (sic) I have with me emails from people who said I didn't vote for you, but you're doing such a great job as Mayor ...</p>


	<p>Lauer: Wait, wait. You're saying two to one in favor of you not resigning?</p>


	<p>West: Not resigning. The mail that's coming to me, the emails that are coming to me are running in my favor not to resign. Stand your ground. They say if the allegations are true, you ought to go. Well, they're not true. But they say if they're not true, stand your ground, you shouldn't be run out for just simple allegations. Because if you can do that, they you can run anybody out of office.</blockquote></p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wabi my Sabi has a link to <a href="http://www.billboardliberation.com/ronald.html">this</a>. It is one of the most brilliant Guerilla Minds Eye Theater events that I have seen in a long time.</p>


	<p>As a Discordian, I feel that the event should not have had meaning at all.</p>


	<p>I do not agree with the agressive tone that some of these things have, for example I would not have invaded a resturant. It is enough to teach. Any time a person tries to block anyone else's choices - that is not freedom. People should be allowed to make stupid choices - but should be educated about the those choices.</p>


	<p>Really just rambling - did I make any sense?</p>]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Yes, a lot of sense.  I agree with you about the aggressiveness and would liked to have seen it remain more of a performance-art type protest.  When the line is crossed from trying to get others to see things from a fresh perspective, to getting in their faces and passing judgement, the teachable moment is lost and there is no communication.  Those under fire are more likely to reject the message if they feel forced into a position of shame.

The message of the protest is important, and the staging was amazing.]]></wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><span class="caps">WENATCHEE</span> , A Chelan County Superior Court judge today said that despite evidence of numerous election errors, Republicans failed to prove those errors cost their candidate the race.

	<p>Gov. Christine Gregoire's narrow win over Republican Dino Rossi stands, the judge ruled.</p>


	<p>'Irregularity ... is not sufficient to invalidate an election,â€ Judge John Bridges said, who was flanked by two sheriff's deputies as he read his lengthy ruling.</p>


	<p>There is no evidence that ballots were changed or that, as Republicans maintained, ballot boxes were 'stuffed,â€ he explained. 'Unless an election is clearly invalid, when the people have spoken, their verdict should not be disturbed by the courts,â€ he added.  </blockquote></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>Dear Friend,

	<p>Every single day 30,000 children die from the effects of extreme poverty and it almost never makes the news. Tonight, that's going to be different.</p>


	<p>I visited Africa last month with Diane Sawyer to record a "Primetime Live" special, and tonight that program will air at 10pm/9pm Central on <span class="caps">ABC</span>. The show is not only about the emergency in Africa, but also about successful projects that are saving people's lives and building new hope in entire communities.</p>


	<p>Yesterday the <span class="caps">ONE</span> campaign asked all of us to do something that will make a real difference for the people we met in Africa: sign a letter  to President Bush asking him to seize the best opportunity we've had in decades to actually end extreme poverty. The <span class="caps">ONE</span> letter asks the President to support three bold commitments at the G8 summit of world leaders on July 6th: more and better international assistance, debt cancellation and trade reform.</p>


	<p>Last week I signed the <span class="caps">ONE</span> letter to President Bush, and since yesterday thousands of you have too. That is an amazing show of support.  The <span class="caps">ONE</span> campaign has set a goal to get <span class="caps">ONE</span> million letter signatures by the upcoming G8 summit on July 6th.  We can get half way there by the end of this week if you join with me and sign the <span class="caps">ONE</span> letter to President Bush and ask your friends and family to sign as well:</p>


	<p>Sign the <span class="caps">ONE</span> letter to President Bush.</p>


	<p>Thanks, and please tell all your friends  to watch the show tonight: 10pm/9pm Central on <span class="caps">ABC</span>.</p>


	<p>Brad Pitt</blockquote></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here is a really good <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/andrewheavens/sets/416158/">photo set</a> from Darfur.</p>


	<p>This is one of the things that I really think is fantastic about the "<em>new media</em>". People are able to post things almost as they happen. You are able to see views into others lives in unprecedented clarity. Shrinking the world is a good thing. If we know our neighbors, and know that they are people with wants, fears and needs just like we are, perhaps we will be less likely to want to kill them.</p>


	<p>I have great hopes for the future.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<title>Why Buddhism?</title>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Several people have asked me the question, "why <a href="http://buddhism.about.com/">Buddhism</a>?" There are several reasons that I feel drawn to this path, and I wanted to take a few moments to expand on them</p>


	<p>First, and foremost, I agree with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhist_philosophy">philosophy</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism#Principles_of_Buddhism">psychology</a>. I have travelled parts of the path, and felt how it can promote internal peace and harmony. It is really a simple and easy path - it just takes doing. What I have gotten out of the baby steps that I have made have been well worth the effort.</p>


	<p>Secondly, there is an ancestral tie there. For those of you that do not know, I have felt a connection with my <a href="http://www.data-wales.co.uk/celt4.htm">Celtic</a> roots most of my life. What does this have to do with Buddhism you ask? Well, that is a long story.</p>


	<p>The Celts came from the steppes of Russia a long time ago. There were two branches of this migration - one into Europe and one into India. They were called the Indo-Europeans. They did develop differently, simply because of the great distances - however many people that study the Celts have commented that the oldest Indian writings, the Rig Vedda, is very similar to the Celtic tales that have been handed down. Some have gone even so far as to say that the stories are the same, except the names are different. In fact, <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=U&#38;start=2&#38;q=http://colfa.utsa.edu/drinka/pie/lang_sanskrit.htm&#38;e=747">Sanskrit and Gaelic</a> even have a common linguistic ancestor.</p>


	<p>As Buddhism is a growth out of the Hindu religious beliefs of 2500 years ago, and the Hindu beliefs are a melding of the Indo-European and the original Indian inhabitants, one could (and some do) draw parallels between the Ancient Celtic beliefs and the Hindu/Buddhist beliefs. There certainly are similarities. Both believe in reincarnation. Both follow the same practices and similar beliefs.</p>


<blockquote>However, the European Celts clearly practiced, and a few still do, more orthodox Vedic type religions, with similar traditions of chanting, rituals, deity worship, mantra and meditation, with direct parallels to most of the ancient and modern orthodox Hindu sects found in India. As such, it is theorized by some scholars that the two branches split because the Celts maintained the older dharma, whereas the people who stayed in the regions north of the Himalayas accepted Buddhism, perhaps from Kashyapa Buddha.</blockquote>

	<p>From <a href="http://www.vedanet.com/HinduCeltic.htm">Hindu and Celtic Culture Are One</a></p>


<blockquote>But in the March issue of Scientific American, British expert Timothy Taylor convincingly resurrects the cauldron's Indian connection. "I saw that the Gundestrup scene showing a pair of elephants flanking a central female figure clearly depicted the ritual bathing of Lakshmi, the Hindu goddess of good fortune."</blockquote>

	<p>from <a href="http://www.hinduismtoday.com/archives/1992/05/1992-05-05.shtml">Hindu Icons on Celt Cauldron</a></p>


<blockquote> Countless studies on European pre-history, ancient languages and religions have brought to light a surprising number of similarities between cultures of the various peoples that lived in the vast area from Ireland to India and from Scandinavia to North Africa. It also appears that the Druids had much in common with the Shamans of Eastern Europe and the Brahmins of India.</blockquote>

	<p>from <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=U&#38;start=7&#38;q=http://www.isle-of-skye.org.uk/celtic-encyclopaedia/celt_c2c.htm&#38;e=747"><span class="caps">CELTS AND HINDUS</span>, The Encyclopaedia of the Celts</a></p>


<blockquote> The Druids of the ancient Celtic world have a startling kinship with the brahmins of the Hindu religion and were, indeed, a parallel development from their common Indo-European cultural root which began to branch out probably five thousand years ago.</blockquote>

	<p>from <a href="http://www.hinduism-today.com/archives/2000/2/2000-2-16.shtml">Our Druid Cousins
</a>
The evidence that the Celts and Druids were related to the very Brahmins that the Buddha preached to is compelling. In fact, I feel that if there had not been the turbulent political climate in Europe that there was, we might have seen a similar development in the Celtic belief system.</p>


	<p>So, there is a connection for me between what the Buddha taught, and what I feel drawn towards. Buddhism is more relevant then the Celtic Religion today, and I feel that I have more of a chance of learning about it, since it's teachings have not yet been eradicated.</p>


	<p>Buddha was a Celt, and so am I.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Short answer - yes, I really do. I have belived in it for years. I do not feel that everyone does - it's more like a choice that we make. If we feel that we have more work to do, we will come back. If we are ready to move on, then we do not. The Celts also belived in a form of reincarnation, as do the Hindu. More then likely the Indo-Europeans did as well.

For me Buddhism is not really a 'religion' as most think of religion. It's more like a owners manual for life. At this time, I do not follow the thinking of the Pure Land Buddhists about Grace, rather I feel that satori/enlightment is a personal achivement. It is with in everyone's grasp, if they are just willing to do the foot work that it requires.

We all crave happyness in life, and we all take diffrent paths attempting to achive it. Buddhism is a road map to lasting, deep happyness. That is what enlightment is all about. It's a lasting feeling of contentment and happyness coupled with a deep understanding of the universe, how it effects us and how we effect it.

Well, enough rambling for today :)]]></wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>So this is the practice of shining light. We look at somebody in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sangha">Sangha</a> and ask ourselves if we are like that person. Maybe we are a twin of that person. We are exactly like that person. When we look at that person we see ourselves, and when we see ourselves we have to practice straight away to change the situation. We have a weakness and we know we have that weakness. Whenever we see that we have a weakness, we accept that we have that weakness. That is awakening; that is enlightenment. Our success in the practice is due to these moments of enlightenment. "I have that weakness and I accept that I have that weakness."</blockquote>

	<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thich_Nhat_Hanh">Thich Nhat Hanh</a></p>


	<p>Living is not all that hard. Living at peace with your fellow beings is not all that hard either. All you have to do is understand that they are people to, and see the world from their perspective. Or at least try.</p>


	<p>In times of War, it is often easier to de-humanize the enemy. Turn them into monsters or some sort of subhuman creature. It is easier on 'your side' to justify killing them. However, I think that we need to step back from this. We need to keep thinking of these people as people. This should not stop us from defending ourselves, however it should be done with the realization that we are killing real people with mothers and fathers and children. Diplomacy should always be our first option, killing our last.</p>


	<p>I think that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taser">Taser gun</a> is a great advancement. I know that there have been deaths associated with the Tasers, and people are all up in arms about this. I ask this however - Which would you rather get shot with? A real gun or a taser? One gives you a chance of survival, one is incredibly destructive to the body. Where ever possible, less then lethal weapons should be used to capture criminals.</p>


	<p>And do not get me wrong, terrorists are simply criminals. Their crimes are grand in scope, but criminals they are none the less. To treat them as combatants in a war gives them and their cause more credibility then they deserve. They are enemies of peace, however they are no different then gangsters. They should be treated as such. Apprehended, and tried for their crimes.</p>


	<p>It takes the wind out of their sails as well. Look at Saddam. If he died in a desperate firefight, he might have become a martyr. Now, he is just a sad old man, standing trial for his crimes.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Another enjoyable post.

Years ago I read a book called &lt;i&gt;On Killing&lt;/i&gt; by Dave Grossman. It discussed a lot of things, but mainly &quot;how efficient&quot; they've become in getting combat soldiers to kill. An interesting read...]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I saw a Discovery channel special on that same issue. The stat's that I recall were:

Before WWI/WWI about 10% of combatants were effective (killing the enemy)

During WWII about 20% effective

Now, 95% effective

It's all about the training that we give our troops. I totally support our troops - and taking an active role in our national defense. However, I do not support overt agression simply 'because'.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[You mentioned on my blog that you had added Generation Kill to your wishlist.

It talks a bit about this issue, and even more demonstrates the mindset of the First Recon Marines the book is about.

In some ways, extremely scary.  Between our Marine training and perhaps the environment they were raised in, we have been able to create some very very efficient killers.

In a war, this is a good thing (although the very need for such a thing is regrettable) but the fact that we can create these people, who in other respects are pretty normal, is troubling.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Ok - 1.43 (2?)gz processor. Swapped out the 256m stick for a 1g stick. 80g HDD, combo drive (CDR/DVD - I did not get the one with the superdrive) Running  OS 10.4. SCREEAMS!. Monitor is a NEC 19 inch Opticlear Flat Panel. I have a Kingston wireless KB/Mouse, and some recycled really old creative speakers.

:)

So far, I am totally impressed with it. Co-worker said &quot;Ok, so now I am going to have to switch - this thing is just slicker then hell&quot;

The upgrade from 10.3 to 10.4 was a breeze. Dashboard is worth it. I am running CAT5e to the desk downstairs where I am putting it right now (taking a break), so I am back on the Ubuntu laptop.

The fast user switch is - well - just way cool. You have to see it to understand.

I put about 300 photos from my thumbdrive on to it, and imported them into iPhoto. Really snazzy. It does red eye, and other basic enhancments with one click. It also has a full-on color/gamma/brightness etc editor.

GarageBand. I opened it and played their demo songs. I must get more into this. I have always wanted to create music, and here is my chance.

I have a Sony handicam, so iMovie is going to be important. I opened it and it looked really easy to play with. I expect that the XP movie editor is a clone.

I have opened iCal, but not gotten past just poking around.]]></wp:comment_content>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I saw parts of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0179116/">But I'm a Cheerleader</a> - and honestly, could not get past the horrid acting. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0332375/">Saved</a> was funny as heck, and probably had a better ending. However, I did not think that <a href="http://www.loveinaction.org/">things</a> like that actually existed!</p>


	<p>Imagine my horror when I read the following on <a href="http://hereticalideas.com/index.php?p=3020">Heretical Ideas</a>.</p>


<blockquote>Well today, my mother, father, and I had a very long "talk" in my room where they let me know I am to apply for a fundamentalist christian program for gays. They tell me that there is something psychologically wrong with me, and they "raised me wrong." I'm a big screw up to them, who isn't on the path God wants me to be on. So I'm sitting here in tears, joing the rest of those kids who complain about their parents on blogs - and I can't help it.</blockquote>

	<p>Not really beliving, I <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2005/6/10/20406/0177">followed</a> a <a href="http://blog.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&#38;friendID=7428306&#38;blogID=29364299&#38;Mytoken=20050614144332">few</a> <a href="http://www.gbconline.net/templates/cusgermantown/details.asp?id=20898&#38;PID=39132">links</a>.  All that I can say is 'wow'.</p>


	<p>Justus has a <a href="http://davejustus.blogspot.com/2005/06/parental-notification.html">post</a> today that is somewhat related about parential notification in cases of abortion. He says</p>


<blockquote>I will back up anyone on having as a part of parental control laws a strong system of counseling and child protective services to deal with this sort of problem. The idea though that a 13 yo girl, when having these sort of problems and facing the need for an abortion should just have minimal tools to try and be self reliant is repellent however.</blockquote>

	<p>This same topic applies here - however it is a fine line. When do we allow the goverment to step in and stop what could amount to toture? When is the freedom of the child eclipsed by the freedoms of the parents to raise their child as they see fit?</p>]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I saw this story via a link on Sandcastles and Cubicles last week I think.

I strongly believe that teens need an adult, in addition to their parents, that they can go to when needed, if nothing else to act as a mediary between them and their parents.

The adjustments of going from a child to an adult require a constant flux in the parental-child relationship, and even the best parents sometimes have trouble keeping up with it.

One of the difficulties though, is that you can't just put an adult there for these kids to go to, it has to be someone they trust, not someone just assigned to them.  However, having a system of councilers and advocates who are at least availible to kids seems very worthwhile.

As to the particulars of programs like this, I am skeptical that they work even for those that want to 'change'.  I am sure that they are a waste of time, money and come close to being torture (at least as bad a Guantanamo anyway) to those who have no desire to be there in the first place.

There are valid, honest reasons to use to convince a 16 gay kid (or a straight kid for that matter) to avoid sexual activity.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I still feel that personal freedoms come first. The issue to me, is where do you draw the line between the child's freedoms and the parents freedoms?

I would support a 'spectrum of freedom' for the children - based on age. As a child ages, they would  (and should) have more freedoms from their parents. I do not agree with no freedom until age 18, and then all.

Parents that fail to impart their moral values at a young age should have less and less control, and responsibility.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[If a child were to become a cultist and inflict harm on themselves, would you support putting that child through a de-conditioning?

It's really kind of the same thing. The parents involved probally really &lt;strong&gt;believe&lt;/strong&gt; that their child is in the grip of the &lt;em&gt;devil&lt;/em&gt;. Even though we disagree with them, if we are to take their rights away, then what if some one disagrees with our beliefs? Do we get stripped of our rights?

That is the fine line that I am concerned with. At what age do we say that a child is mature enough to make up their minds about issues like this? At what age does a parent loose complete control over their child? At what age does a child's right to choose their life's path eclipse the rights of a parent?

I agree that sending their child to a place like this is abhorrent, not to mention the guilt and pain they caused when they told him the things that they did. However I do not know if it my right, or the state's right to interfear with their parenting choices of their child.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Tsykoduk says, &quot;At what age does a parent loose complete control over their child?&quot;

When they are born.  :)

It's always an unfortunate situation when children get caught up in parental lunacy.  However I do not feel the 18 year old limit is a terrible one.

Sure there are kids who mature quicker, either biologically or because their situation forces them to. The fact remains that most kids, seemingly mature or not, cannot handle important decisions on their own.

As we can tell from this story though, many parents can't make good decisions either.

There is not an easy canned answer to this problem, so this leaves us with laws that try to protect as many of our children as we can.

Can parents force religious beliefs on there children?  It's sad, but yes they can.  Hopefully when children become &quot;adults&quot; they will remember their oppression and make an informed choice.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I think a very good argument can be made that 18 is too old to start taking full responsibility for oneself.

Unfortunately though, we live in a very technologically complex culture that really requires education into the 20s before one can be self-sufficient.  And it is almost axiomatic that one cannot expect to be fully responsible for oneself, if one is not self-sufficient.

I think that there are a lot of problems with our delayed entry into the adult world.  I don't know that there are any simple solutions however.]]></wp:comment_content>

It's quite a conflict for me, and the only way I can get around it is by my firm belief that being gay or bi is not a choice, but an inborn biological component.

Now. Ask me if it should matter if being gay or bi WERE a choice, and I get even more confused.

Incidentally, I was wondering what you thought of this, in light of the above post and conversation: http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory?id=856748&amp;amp;CMP=OTC-RSSFeeds0312

I can't come to a firm opinion on it because I have thus far been unable to ascertain how the girl herself feels about the whole thing. Which leads me to believe I must put a fair amount of weight on what a child wants, at least after a certain age.]]></wp:comment_content>

It's quite a conflict for me, and the only way I can get around it is by my firm belief that being gay or bi is not a choice, but an inborn biological component.&lt;/em&gt;

I understand the emotional vs the logical conundrum. I hit it in several of my beliefs. However, my solution is that to remember the following - emotion is fleeting, and fickle. Logic will stay the same no matter what. Choices based in logic have a better chance of remaining for the best, while ones based on emotion tend to be knee jerk responses which might seem silly or poorly thought out with hindsight.

As to the young girl - it's sad, however she is at the age where her parents have that say. The state has a safety net, where if they feel that the parents are neglecting or abusing the child there are steps that they can take - and it seems that Texas has taken those steps.

I agree that the child's opinion should have some weight in the matter, but the final choice should be the parents (if they are not fit, then the state).]]></wp:comment_content>

I agree that quick emotional choices are often bad.  But if I think something out for a while, can't put my finger on why I feel a certain way but maintain my strong feelings even after long examination I tend to go with my gut.  In those cases I continue to re-examine my position though and often eventually find what my reasoning was missing.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[&lt;em&gt;I think there are times however when logic fails us and we emotionally, or intuitively know that something is so even though we cannot put our finger on why.&lt;/em&gt;

I would propose that is our subconscious coming to a logical outcome with more information, or a more detached view, then we are capable of at the time.

A hunch is simply parts of your mind that you cannot readily access making connections that you cannot. I'll be that when you do re-examine your position, you find that there was logic behind the choice that you made - just logic that you could not use or find at the time.

Becca - If 1 + 1 = 2 now, will it not equal the same thing in a year? 10 years? 1000 years? There are inescapable underpinnings of logic everywhere you look. The difficult part is making a logical determination based on (what will always be) faulty or incomplete information. That's why we have to be able to estimate in a unemotional fashion what would be the best choice, logically, based on the information at hand.

Best choice is another concept entirely! :)]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I have a 14-year-old daughter, and three sons younger than that.  The thought that my daughter could have an abortion without my knowledge mortifies me.  How in the world am I supposed to be as good a parent as I can be without that kind of information available to me?  This goes for any major medical procedure on my kids, male or female.

The state is not in a position to legislate morality in issues like abortion.  By allowing the state to do so what they advocate is an almost complete lack of morality by enabling decisions like this to be made without the knowledge or consent of the parents, who, ostensibly, know and love their children best.

18 is a good age limit.  If a child can prove that they do not need their parents by age 16 they can be emancipated, but those cases a very, very rare.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[&quot;&lt;em&gt;The state is not in a position to legislate morality in issues like abortion.&lt;/em&gt;&quot;

I would postulate that the state is not in a position to legislate morality in any manner.

The state exists to protect my rights, and yours. That is all. When you try to take away my rights (say, by shooting me) the state should interceed. However they should not do so on moral grounds (it's wrong to kill) but on the grounds that my rights are infringed upon by your taking them away.

I guess that the article was a reflection on the difficulty in judging when a child's rights to privacy and lifestyle choice eclipse the rights of a parent to make those choices for that child. I feel that this should be a case by case basis. There are parents that do not &quot;&lt;em&gt;know and love their children best&lt;/em&gt;&quot; nor keep their best intrest at heart. In cases like this, I think that  some one needs to interceed on the child's behalf. However, if the parents are at least 1/2 human, then they should be able to, well, parent their children.]]></wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>It's <span class="caps">BACK</span>!</strong></p>


	<p>TV.com <a href="http://www.tv.com/story/story.html&#038;story_id=335">reports:</a></p>


<blockquote>Firefly, a science fiction series that was canceled midway through its first season on Fox, has found a new home on the Sci Fi Channel. All existing episodes will air this summer, though there is no word on a second season</blockquote>

	<p>And SciFi <a href="http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire2005/index.php?category=0&#38;id=31260">says</a>:</p>


<blockquote>
<span class="caps">SCI FI</span> Channel announced that it will air reruns of Fox's canceled SF series Firefly, including three episodes that never aired on Fox. <span class="caps">SCI FI</span> will air all 14 hours of the show, from creator Joss Whedon (Buffy the Vampire Slayer), starting July 22, in the 7 p.m. ET/PT Friday timeslot. It will be followed by new episodes of Stargate SG-1 at 8, Stargate Atlantis at 9 and Battlestar Galactica at 10.</blockquote>

	<p>Fantasic news. I hope, if the <a href="http://www.serenitymovie.com/">movie</a> does well, and the series does well, that SciFi will start in on new episodes. What a Friday lineup! Get your <span class="caps">DVR</span>'s primed for July 22!</p>


	<p>If you have not seen the trailer for the FireFly move - run, don't walk <a href="http://www.serenitymovie.com/">here</a> and watch it. Several times.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>And I am in love with my Mac Mini. <span class="caps">OS X</span> is slick, quick and very user friendly. The dashboard has quickly become a favorite application. I have a very cluttered dashboard. :)</p>


	<p>From automatically displaying some of my favorite comics to a slick word of the day applet this thing has a lot of cool features.</p>


	<p>My favorite is called 'Buzztracker'. They even have a <a href="http://www.buzztracker.org">website</a>. Ok, so the website came before the widget, but what ever. It displays a map of the world, with little red specks for news items, and ranks the areas of the world by how much news is generated. Today I have watched Gaza, which started with the lead at about 16%, end up 4th (even under Madrid) with only 6%. Cool stuff.</p>


	<p>Other then that, there is a ton of great software out there (yes, great software). I downloaded and installed NeoOffice/J, a port of Open Office for the Mac, and have had all the convenience of Open Office 1.x at my fingertips.</p>


	<p>Still posting from the widget for Wordpress. Oh - you have got to see the <span class="caps">RSS</span> reader in Safari. Wow. makes keeping up with my <span class="caps">RSS</span> feeds a snap.</p>


	<p>I feel sad, but I actually enjoy using this computer more then my Linux boxes. When Gnome or <span class="caps">KDE</span> gets to this level of sophistication, which I am sure that it will, I will be overjoyed.</p>


	<p>The only thing that I miss from Linux is the ability to skin Gnome or <span class="caps">KDE</span> so much. Especially Gnome. Apple has done a fantastic job of making the look and feel of <span class="caps">OS X</span> really polished, but I like to play with the icons and window borders a wee bit.</p>


	<p>Not a lot to complain about. The machine is really well built, silent, stylish, and seems to be crash proof. I have a firewall on my router, but I have not configured the one on this computer yet.</p>


	<p>Anyways, time for bed. Nite all!</p>]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Way cool.

I have long felt that the big issue with Linux is that too many of the developer base enjoyed having an 'elite' system that took extensive knowledge to operate.  They don't want a system that anyone can use because of an intrinsic belief that only knowedgable people should be using computers.

Foolish in my opinion.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I think that some of the backend people (kernel hackers and the like) might feel that, but the GUI folks (GNOME and KDE) are trying really hard to get *nix up to a good standard of User Friendliness.

For a lot of the hackers that I have talked to/read/interacted with it's more of a religious thing. They want to only use 'free' software because they do not agree with software patents.

I do not hold that belief. I use 'free' software because I am cheap, and I do not really want to pay $699 for an office package. I have no problem using software that is encumbered by patents or restrictive licenses. I do follow those licenses, however.]]></wp:comment_content>

I just keep getting more impressed]]></wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>In the decade since I left the Senate, American politics has been characterized by two phenomena: the increased activism of the Christian right, especially in the Republican Party, and the collapse of bipartisan collegiality. I do not think it is a stretch to suggest a relationship between the two. To assert that I am on God's side and you are not, that I know God's will and you do not, and that I will use the power of government to advance my understanding of God's kingdom is certain to produce hostility.</blockquote>

	<p><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=JOHN+C.+DANFORTH">
John C. Danforth</a> has a lot to say about the current crop of right wing Christians in this N.Y. Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/17/opinion/17danforth.html?ex=1119844800&#38;en=ff5dd6ef0c0d9b2a&#38;ei=5070&#38;emc=eta1">article</a>. It's a very good read, and should be taken to heart. If more Christians followed Mr. Danforth's beliefs, I feel that Christianity would not be at the crossroads that it is today.</p>


	<p>Conversely, if the political parties took his advice to heart, I do not think that the country would be in the state that it is today. We, as a people, are far to divided. We engender hatred over politics. I am sorry, but Hatred over politics is just plain silly. The differences between Bush's and Kerry's platforms were trivial. It all came down to character - not actions and path. We are in a country where every election is poised to become a court battle 'because we did not win!' And we are trying to bring the rest of the world into Democracy. Perhaps we should lead with our actions, instead of just words.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wabi my Sabi has an interesting <a href="http://wabimysabi.blogdrive.com/archive/122.html">post:</a></p>


<blockquote>Judaism, Christianity, and <del>- to a lesser extent -</del> Islam have all developed the idea of a personal God, so we tend to think that this ideal represents religion at its best.  The personal God has helped monotheists to value the sacred and inalienable rights of the individual and to cultivate an appreciation of human personality.  The Judeo-Christian tradition has thus helped the West to acquire the liberal humanism it values so highly.</blockquote>

	<p>There are various logical and philosphical issues with there being a God and this article exposes some of the issues when you make God into a person. When you anthropomorphize something, you assign it human attributes where none exist. For example, you might feel that your computer is 'out to get you' when your computer, in fact, is no more capable of caring about you at all then making you a latte with extra foam after giving you a back rub.</p>


<blockquote>Yet a personal God can become a grave liability.  He can be a mere idol carved in our own image, a projection of our limited needs, fears and desires.  We can assume that he loves what we love and hates what we hate, endorsing our prejudices instead of compelling us to transcend them</blockquote>

	<p>Giving the Godhead a personality is a dangerous road to travel. We then can assign him emotions. Perhaps he hates our enemys as much as we do? Perhaps he condones acts of barbarism on them, as they are his hated foe? Perhaps he feels that we should take the civil liberties of a certain class of people becuase they are 'dirty' or 'evil' in his eyes?</p>


	<p>We need to move beyond a personal God to a transcendental Godhead which <strong>is</strong> compassion and love for all creatures and things.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://securityawareness.blogspot.com/">Security Awareness for Ma, Pa and the Corporate Clueless</a> says:</p>


<blockquote>Antonio Marcelli killed people for a living. At least a few he admitted to. The feds caught him, he turned state's evidence, testified in open court against the capos and subsequently entered the witness protection program. He was safe until his new name and location hit the Internet.

	<p>A computer junkie from Kentucky had bought a heap of old hard drives that the Justice Department had discarded. Lo and behold, names and addresses of people in the witness protection program popped up in a perfectly readable format.</blockquote></p>


	<p>Wow. There are (or should be) standards for 'cleaning' data off of gear that is old and gotten rid of. Following them might be another thing, as this case shows.</p>


	<p>This helps to show that there can be real consequences for computer security (or a lack thereof)</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>Catholic term for the sin of most heretic groups who attempt to either create heaven or hell in this world instead of waiting for it in the next.</blockquote>
From <a href="http://www.chaosmatrix.org/library/chaos/texts/ite.html">Chaos Matrix</a>

People seem to expect perfection from their leaders – they want Heaven on Earth, but complain that they are living in Hell on earth when <em>their</em> leaders are not elected. They fret that everything is not perfect, they explode when things are not 100% the way that they want them to be. They are trying to live in a “Heaven” on earth. Sadly, this does not work, and leads them to more frustration, fear and loathing of what ever they see standing in their way. It’s a downward spiral into depression, rage and death.
<blockquote>Winston Churchill noted that, “Those whose minds are attracted or compelled to rigid and symmetrical systems of government should remember that … human beings and human societies are not structures that are built or machines that are forged. They are plants that grow and must be treated as such.”

As an old (and gleefully incomprehensible) conservative slogan puts it: Don’t Immanentize the Eschaton! That is, heaven ain’t coming to earth, and the standard by which governments and their policies must be judged is not some fantastical Kingdom of Heaven on earth..</blockquote>
From <a href="http://barometer.orst.edu/vnews/display.v/ART/2005/05/25/4294a5209a99e">The Daily Barometer Online</a>

Living under unrealistic expectations will always lead to unhappiness. This is why Buddhists teach that <em>Life is Suffering</em>. When you expect suffering and hardship, those moments of peace and happiness are all the more sweet.

However, this concept goes far beyond mere happiness for individuals. When leaders start to try to create their vision of Heaven or Hell on earth, bad things can happen
<blockquote>For Voegelin, as least in his role as political scientist, the great dividing line is between certainty and uncertainty. The good thing is uncertainty. Why? Because people who are certain about humanity's ends often seek to divinize society, to reunite heaven and earth, by establishing within this world the true and final purposes of man. For Voegelin, this form of certainty is the great threat to humanity. For the man who is certain in this way will not leave the transfiguration of the world to the grace of God beyond history but will do the work of God himself, right here and now, in history. Cromwell was certain in this way. Lenin and Hitler were, if anything, even more certain. Indeed, leaders and social movements possessed of this type of certainty shaped much of the 20th century, including almost all of its bloodiest and ugliest parts</blockquote>
From <a href="http://www.propositionsonline.com/html/uncertain.html">Uncertain</a> by David Blankenthorn

Uncertainty should be a part of our lives. When we know that we have ultimate truth (if such a thing can exist) we have the mindset that anyone that disagrees with us is wrong. If they are wrong, and cannot be convinced other wise, then they are flawed. If they are flawed, then they need to be helped. If they cannot be helped, then they are the enemy!

I propose a simpler philosophy:
<blockquote>It is my firm belief that the mistake your mistake is trying to understand. How can one understand the Goddess of confusion? Then again it is our firm belief that it is a mistake to hold firm beliefs. If you believe it. Hail Eris!</blockquote>
-Episkopos Galactus I, Keeper of the sacred Backbacon (23 Sep. 1996).

When we are able to see that all belief structures come from the same essential chaos, our lives will be happier and simpler. When we see that anything that we hold dear is simply a fleeting image and not real, we will be able to deal with life, death, and politics with grace and ease.
<blockquote>This was on the fifth night, and when they slept that night each had a vivid dream of a splendid woman whose eyes were as soft as a feather and as deep as eternity itself…she spoke in a warm and gentle voice: ‘I have come to tell you that you are free. Many ages ago, My consciousness left man, that he might develop himself. I return to find this development approaching completion, but hindered by fear and by misunderstanding. You have built yourselves psychic suits of armor, and clad in them, your vision is restricted…your spirit broiled by the sun. I am chaos. I am the substance from which your artists and scientists build rhythms…I am alive and I tell you that you are free</blockquote>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[&lt;em&gt;Some of it is a positively medieval outlook on things however. I do not believe we should be content to suffer. I do not believe that we cannot improve our state.&lt;/em&gt;

I don't think that I ever said to be content in suffering. Expecting perfection is different from striving for happiness.

I think that the major difference is in the word expecting vs striving. We can work towards the best possible form of government, we can work towards a happy and  fulfilling life - we should not &lt;b&gt;expect&lt;/b&gt; those things however.

We must understand that we do not hold ultimate truth however, as that is a inherently dangerous concept. We must hold a &lt;em&gt;firm belief that it is a mistake to hold firm beliefs&lt;/em&gt;. My intent in this article was to make three points. First, that we cannot expect perfection in anything of this world. Secondly, a healthy dose of uncertainty is good for the soul, and thirdly, that I had a hard time making the first two points.]]></wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><span class="caps">WEST</span>: Today my lawyers are filing an appeal to allow the state Supreme Court to review the recall petition filed against me. The citizens of Spokane deserve to know why I have decided to appeal. Simply put, it is because the charges are false, and the ballot statement they would vote on was improperly prepared and is prejudicial.

	<p><span class="caps">WHITECAPS</span>: If the charges in Shannon Sullivan's recall petition are false, West's lawyers are skilled enough to show that, and the voters of Spokane are intelligent enough to see it. It is West's lawyers' job to make his side of the story known to the electorate who would vote in the recall petition. Questioning the adequacy of the form and content of the ballot is appropriately the duty of the Spokane County Auditor. Putting that question to the State Supreme Court now would be premature since the ballot has yet to be prepared. If the ballot wording is prejudicial, it can be contested once it has been finalized.</blockquote></p>


	<p><a href="http://whitecaps.blogspot.com/2005/06/response-to-spokane-mayor-james-west.html">Whitecaps</a> does a very good job of a point by point response to Mayor West's rebuttal and actions over the last few weeks.</p>


	<p>If the Mayor is so certain that he is not guilty and still fit for the job, then he should let the recall go forward. If he is infact still fit for the job, he should not have an issue convincing the voters of that.  However, his actions speak of fear, not confidence.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I am doubtful of West's innocence.

However, to play devil's advocate here, one can be innocent of any crime and still be the subject of an unfair witchhunt, and burned at the stake.

Certainly some aspects of this whole matter do have a witchhunt flavor about them.

In this case though, West may be an actual 'witch.']]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I agree that witchhunts are bad. If this is a witchhunt, then let him come out to the public with credible evidence. Face the recall head on and beat it. Not drown it in a morass of court cases. I would like nothing more then to see that.

However, his actions to date smack of some one who is afraid. Fearfullness does not a leader make.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I hope beyond all hope (as do most of my public service co-workers) that West is run out of town on a recall ballot rail.  In my department of the City I would have been TERMINATED for doing what West admits to doing.  He should face the same level of investigation and judgment as the rest of us civil servers would face, or perhaps more because he is the MAYOR for crying out loud.

If he is innocent and righteous he should welcome the ballot and have nothing to fear.  Witch hunts notwithstanding, the truth would set him free were it a good truth to begin with.  As it is, he screwed up...big time.  He should be punished accordingly.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I can imagine that if he is innocent and gay he might not welcome the ballot box.  Spokane  voters might well conclude someone didn't commit and crimes but still should not be mayor simply on because of their sexual orientation.

The allegations of child abuse I find pretty credible, and that is what concerns me with him.  I don't care if he gets it on with an 18 yo guy.  I don't even care a lot about the job offer deal (that happens a lot I am sure.)  If there is evidence to prosecute him, that should be done.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[If the molestation allegations can be proven credible, then that's obviously going to be my main problem. However, I find it unlikely that, as far removed from the alleged incidents as we are now, time-wise that will come to pass. Unfortunate if he did in fact do it.

Picked up the Inlander while I was out there this weekend. There was a ton in there about the whole deal; I haven't had a chance to wade through all of it yet.]]></wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Read the following (from <a href="http://sprg.ssl.berkeley.edu/~wcoburn/hpl/fungi.html">Fungi from Yuggoth</a>)</p>


<blockquote>It is a certain hour of twilight glooms,
Mostly in autumn, when the star-wind pours
Down hilltop streets, deserted out-of-doors,
But shewing early lamplight from snug rooms.
The dead leaves rush in strange, fantastic twists,
And chimney-smoke whirls round with alien grace,
Heeding geometries of outer space,
<em>While Fomalhaut peers in through southward mists.</em>

	<p>This is the hour when moonstruck poets know
What fungi sprout in Yuggoth, and what scents
And tints of flowers fill Nithon's continents,
Such as in no poor earthly garden blow.
Yet for each dream these winds to us convey,
A dozen more of ours they sweep away!</blockquote></p>


	<p>Now, go look at <a href="http://www.newscientistspace.com/data/images/ns/9999/99997564F1.JPG">this</a> and realize that it's the star <em><a href="http://www.solstation.com/stars/fomalhau.htm">Fomalhaut</a></em>. No, <a href="http://www.newscientistspace.com/article/dn7564">Really</a>!</p>


	<p>Wonder what ol' Lovecraft really knew?</p>]]></content:encoded>

	<p>I think that a lot of religous folks should take these comments to heart. And I am not just talking about Christians here. There are a lot of other religous folks that feel that they have the exclusive ownership of some universal truth that transends all, but cannot be proven by empirical or logical reasoning.</p>


	<p>To this I say - Bull. Faith is not enough to validate a universal truth.</p>


	<p>Let's look at what the Truth about Truth is:</p>


<blockquote>truth (trÅ«th) pronunciation
n., pl. truths (trÅ«THz, trÅ«ths).

   1. Conformity to fact or actuality.
   2. A statement proven to be or accepted as true.
   3. Sincerity; integrity.
   4. Fidelity to an original or standard.
   5.
         1. Reality; actuality.
         2. often Truth That which is considered to be the supreme reality and to have the ultimate meaning and value of existence.</blockquote>

	<p>(From <a href="http://www.answers.com/truth&#38;r=67">Answers.com</a>). We can throw out meaning #2 right now, as it is <a href="http://www.answers.com/recursive">recursive.</a> Truth, by definition, is based in fact. Not faith. When some one decides to blow themselves up, I would hope that they have truth on their side, and not faith. Did Jesus want people to declare Crusades in his name? Burn witches in his name? Or, did he want people to just get along and love one and another?</p>


	<p>I do not discount people's right to choose what they believe. However, this belief should be held with the understanding that it might not be consistent with fact or reality. This should temper their understanding of other's choices to believe as they see fit. When you understand that you, in point of fact, do not really understand how the universe works, it makes you more humble. We are like worms living in an apple. We think that is the entire world, not seeing the tree, roots, seeds and other apples.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[What's wrong with Jedi Knights?  These people are not using light sabers, or flying through the universe, but they have recognized a cause that stands for the protection of all beings, and they believe in all the things that the Jedi in the movies do.

Granted it's a bit strange to hitch your spiritual wagon to a religion from a movie, but I wouldn't mind sharing my world with the order of Jedi Knights.  In fact, I'd welcome their gallant belief that everyone should just learn to play nicely together.

Christians may have big problem with that, because it encroaches on their plan to dominate the world.  ;)]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Taking that on faith is not a bad thing. However, holding that truth - and holding it as a universal truth - would you feel like converting a pessimist to your cause? If he did not convert, would you want to kill him?

That is an extreme case, however when some on has a 'if you do not belive as we do, then you are the enemy' out look can make the jump to extremism very easly.

Every fath that has 'universal truth' on it's side has these extremists. The Christians have the Abortion Doctor killers, the Crusades, the KKK, the Irish Catholics and Prodistians, the Witch Burnings. The Muslems have the current spate of terror.

Meme Structures need to include tolerance, or they should be consitered toxic, and fought with all of the vigor of an outbreak of small pox or ebola. Too many of the current religous Memes do not include tolerance, or simply pay lip service to it.

At one time, I was close to a fundementalist Christian. I have studied the bible, I have lived the life. However, I found that it was lacking for me. That is my personal choice. If you want to belive in God on High - more power to you. However, you need to examine the philophsy behind what is being taught to you in Church. There are sick people everywhere. Some one that feels a God Given Right to take my freedom of choice of religion away is sick. They have a toxic meme and need to be treated like some one with Ebola or Small Pox or AIDS. With compassion, care and treatment.

I side with the Republicans on many issues. I do not agree when it comes to taking away rights via Goverment control. That is, in point of fact, a liberal stance. Liberals think that the goverment should control us. Conservitives favor small goverment that stays out of people's way.]]></wp:comment_content>

There can almost be no comparison between religious killings and non-religious killings.

It seems killing those who don't agree with you is one of the primary actions for the religious fanatics (note, I do not mean that every religious person would do, or would condon this).

Non-religious folks may kill for things like the belief that their family must be protected, but short of that there really is no other reason to kill someone if you're a non-believer.

We're not even factoring in common thugs and criminals, they're a whole different whacked out bunch.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Any toxic meme is a bad thing - not just religous ones. I think that religous toxicity is at a forefront, as many of the major world religions have a checkered past. Religon is also a perfect medium to pass on toxic memes - as many of them are very concerned with creating an enviroment that allows it's meme to be passed on. The concept of Faith is a perfect example of this. It asks us to not think about &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt;, but to simply accept &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt;. A perfect example is the Christian view of themselves as 'sheep' or 'lambs' of God. Sheep are unquestioning followers. I am not a sheep. I am a wolf. I prowl, question, probe. I do not blindly accept.

Turning off the logical portions of my brain is not possible anymore. I cannot rely on faith alone. I must &quot;&lt;i&gt;Kill the Buddha&lt;/i&gt;&quot;, and question everything. If a preist tells me that the moon is made of Goat Cheese, then I am going to try and travel there to verify that claim - or put the burden on him to prove it.

Lacking hard emperical evidence, there has to be a logical consitiancy. Experimental evidence shows that the moon probally cannot be made of Goat Cheese. Goat Cheese is soft and crumbly. Using basic logic and physics, one would determine that a object the size of the moon that was made out of Goat Cheese should deteriorate quickly. Especally when thumped with large objects travelling at high speeds, as the moon has been. Ergo, the moon has a very high probability of not being made out of Goat Cheese.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I question your logic on the whole goat cheese moon issue.  While certainly small amounts of goat cheese are soft and crumbly, and object the size of the moon would be greatly compacted due to gravitiational pressure.

Further, I will of course kill you if you don't believe the moon is made of goat cheese.

Based upon this logic you might want to alter your beliefs

:)

And - in re the goat cheese. I have done experments with Goat Cheese. I have made it into balls and flung it at things. It stays crumbly. As I do not have a moon-sized hunk of goat cheese (and the moon is not goat cheese, so we do not have ready access to a moon sized hunk of goat cheese) it is hard to say what would happen under such extreme compression.

So, I decided to make a small experment. I squished some goat cheese to see if it became stronger. It did not - it simply squished all over the place.

So, I stand behind my belief that if the moon were made of Goat Cheese, it would not be able to hold it's current roundish form.]]></wp:comment_content>

What if you're wrong, oh yes, you very well could be wrong.  The moon is not made of Goat Cheese at all, but Swiss Cheese, which accounts for all of the surface holes we can see.

My Flat Earth buddies and I are in complete agreement on this fact.]]></wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>As many of you know, <span class="caps">EFF</span> represented StreamCast in the <span class="caps">MGM</span> v. Grokster case.  The Supreme Court's decision held that software innovators may be held liable for inducing the copyright infringement of their users.  <span class="caps">EFF</span> believes that the Court unleashed the potential for a torrent of new litigation by creating a test that has many factors, is very fact-specific, and is difficult to predict.  The Court also set us up for a world where consumers are given fewer choices in the marketplace, because innovators will be scared to introduce products that do not have Hollywood's seal of approval.

	<p>There is no question that there will be a flood of litigation as a result of this decision, as well as congressional hearings.  <span class="caps">EFF</span> must be there to represent the rights of innovators and consumers in the fights to come.  Now, more than ever, we need your support to continue to protect innovation and new technologies in cyberspace.</p>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over at Wired they have an <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/infrastructure/0,1377,68004,00.html?tw=wn_6techhead">article</a> about a 'new Internet' that is in development. There is a lot of discussion about the 'clean slate' vs the 'incremental changes' idea of implementing this new idea.</p>


	<p><a href="http://www.networksorcery.com/enp/authors/ClarkDavidD.htm">David Clark</a> is heading up the 'clean slate' group that is working on their ideas at the  <a href="http://www.nlr.net/">National LambdaRail</a>.</p>


<blockquote>"Look at phishing and spam, and zombies, and all this crap," said Clark. "Show me how six incremental changes are going to make them go away."</blockquote>

	<p>Well. Let me tell you about <span class="caps">ONE</span> change that will make about 90% of that 'crap' go away, Mr Clark. Stop using Windows!</p>


	<p>The statistics clearly show that Windows is not an 'Internet Ready' operating system. <a href="http://www.sophos.com/">Sophos,</a> a major Anti virus vendor just released the results of a test that they did - and an <a href="http://www.zdnet.com.au/news/security/0,2000061744,39200021,00.htm">unprotected Windows system has a 50% of being compromised in the first 12 minutes</a> of being attached to the Internet. In the first quarter of 2005, 8000 viruses were released into the wild for Windows.</p>


	<p>A lot of people respond with "Well, <a href="http://www.ubuntulinux.org">Linux</a> and <a href="http://www.apple.com">Mac</a> don't have the market share. Virus writers don't want to target them because there are not a lot of them out there." To that, I say - Hogwash! Let's look at the numbers.</p>


	<p><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_stats.asp">
<table class="ex" cellspacing="0" border="1" width="100%">
  <tr></p>

  <td>January</td>
  <td align="right">61.3%</td>
  <td align="right">21.6%</td>
  <td align="right">5.3%</td>
  <td align="right">1.0%</td>

  <td align="right">1.2%</td>
  <td align="right">3.2%</td>
  <td align="right">2.8%</td>
</tr></table></a>

	<p>So, according to the stats from the <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/">w3schools</a> - <a href="http://www.ubuntulinux.org">Linux</a> and <a href="http://www.apple.com">Mac</a> have about 3% of the on-line market each. If there were 8000 virus writing in <span class="caps">Q1 2005</span>, would you not expect to see about 6% of them to target Linux and or Mac? Where are those 500 viruses? They are not there - because it's a combination of factors that makes Windows such a choice target, not just pure numbers.</p>


	<p>Windows was designed as a single user system. It was not designed as a networked system from the start. It has had all of these bells and whistles added on after the fact. Shoe-horned on, if you want the truth. *nix (OS X, <span class="caps">BSD</span>, AIX, Linux etc) have all been designed with networking as a core concept. When you design a system with networking as a core concept, you tend to give some thought as to how to make sure that people that you do not want in are not allowed in. It's as simple as that.</p>


	<p>Microsoft did not have security as a core concept until Windows <span class="caps">XP SP2</span> - about 2 years ago. <span class="caps">BSD</span> has been doing it for 30 years. You make the choice.</p>


	<p>I am not saying that there will never be security issues with these other OS's - rather that they are <em>more</em> secure by default. It's like a house. If you are going to store valuables, what are you going to store them in? A grass hut or a steel vault? Even if you choose the steel vault and you leave the door wide open, you are going to have problems.</p>


	<p>So - instead of doing a rip and replace on the Internet to improve security, lets go ahead and deal with the source of the problem. The Internet is a collection of networks of computers. Let's push the security to where it belongs - the computers that make up the networks. Asking the network to secure it's self is like asking the roads to stop people from breaking into our houses.</p>


	<p>So, lock the doors to your house, and make sure that it's not a straw house.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.michaelhanscom.com/eclecticism/2005/07/you_dirty_pedop.html">Michael Hanscom</a> talks about an experience yesterday (July 4th 2005):</p>


<blockquote>I was having a good day wandering around Myrtle Edwards Park for the Fourth of Jul-Ivar's festivities until someone sicced the security goons on me. Apparently a parent had decided that since I was taking pictures of kids playing in the surf at one of the small beach areas, I was some creepy scumbag who had to be brought to heel.

	<p>One security guy came up to me and pulled me aside, telling me that there had been complaints that I was taking pictures of children.</blockquote></p>


<more>

	<p>Michael goes on to explain that he freely deleted the pictures of the clothed children playing in the public park, but was told that if he stayed, 'he would be watched'</p>


	<p>I think that Michael sums it up nicely with:</p>


<blockquote>Happy Fourth of July everyone. You know â€” independence, liberty, freedom, and civil rights and all that.</blockquote>

	<p>This all comes back to the culture of fear that we live in. The media has us scared into thinking that we are in deathly fear for our lives, and crime and dismemberment are right around the corner.</p>


	<p>The statistics simply do not show this, however. If you read my <a href="http://greg.nokes.name/2004/10/19/politics-media-and-personal-safety/">earlier post</a>, you will see that crime is in fact <em>down</em> in the US. However, with the advent of global coverage - we see the few crimes that are committed spread sea to shining sea. We get daily, or hourly, updates on the fate of a missing girl in Aruba. While that is a very sad occurrence, how many people were in Aruba vacationing that weekend? What percentage were abducted? Does the media tell us  this? Or do they just focus on the fear that they can generate?</p>


	<p>That does not sell papers. Fear sells papers. Let's look at the war in Iraq. We are horrified that we have lost <a href="http://www.antiwar.com/casualties/">1746 people</a> in Iraq since the inception of hostilities on 3/19/03. That's 1% of the <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/iraq_orbat.htm">170,000</a> troops that we have on the ground. In '<a href="http://web1.whs.osd.mil/mmid/casualty/castop.htm">Nam</a> we lost 58,209 people, out of 2,594,000 serving. That's 2.2% losses. <a href="http://web1.whs.osd.mil/mmid/casualty/castop.htm">Korea</a> was worse - with 54,246 total deaths out of 1,789,000 on the ground. That's just over 3% dead. The world wars are even more grossly horrific. So, for being at war, we are doing pretty well.</p>


	<p>As an aside, 170,000 in Iraq is a very conservative estimate. I was looking for the total number of troops that have served in the theater, as the numbers from the rest of the conflicts are based on total numbers that served through the conflict not the highest force levels. I have found numbers in the 250,000 range, but none from really good sources. With the quarter million number, the <span class="caps">KIA</span> percentage is an even lower %1/2.</p>


	<p>However, the media plays what they want you to see up. They do not show reality in the true light, rather in what ever light sells more papers, and advances their agenda. The media no longer is impartial. They are trying to sell the public a bill of goods. "Stay at home - be afraid - listen to us and we will tell you about all of the horrible things out there!"</p>


	<p>So, you can hide behind your locked doors, looking out of the drawn curtains, or you can free yourself and go out into the world, safely, sanely and with the correct amount of precautions.</p>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[It does not matter if there is a conspiracy, or it's just expediency - the fact is that the media in this country is breeding a culture of fear. By running stories that say 'Crime is on the Rise!' and 'Some Kid Got Killed in Podunksville' they highlight the negative rather then the real.

For example, the Media would like us to believe that Crime is on the rise. Which it is. There were more crimes committed this year in the US then 5 years ago. However, we have more people now, so per person the crime rate is in fact down. Crimes per person are more relevant, but saying that crime is at an all time high creates more fear. Which one does the U.S. media report? That crime is at an all time high!

A more fair report would be that While there are more crimes committed, there are less victims per capita then ever before. But that does not sell papers to the public that the mass media has created. We, as a culture, crave fear. We feed on others tragedy. The Mass Media has created this lust for others misfortune by feeding us with a steady diet of Jerry Springer, Oprah, Survivor, and Bad News for the last 20 years. Where in this morass of misfortune is the positive programming that we need?

Now, before I get accused of calling the kettle black, I enjoy a good Action movie as much as the next person, however I know the difference between movies and reality. I do not go out of my way to watch all of the bad news that I can - in fact I try and concentrate on the positive news as much as possible. The world is getting better folks! Really! Look at Lebanon, Iraq, Afghanistan, the G8 summit. 20 years ago we would have never heard about Darfur, and now we can see pictures from it in real time.

When evil raises it's head - now more then ever the entire world finds out. That is a good thing. The bad thing is when the Mass Media reports only on that evil - and makes it sound like if you leave your house, you will die/be mugged/be raped or what ever.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I think it may be worthwhile to make a distinction between the media cultivating a culture of fear about things like Iraq, and parents being cautious about someone taking random pictures of their children. The problem is you don't KNOW who's a pervert and who isn't. Sometimes it's best to err on the side of caution--or to at least keep one eye on people. It's unfortunate, but it's true. Look at some of the reports coming out of St. Regis about Joseph Duncan--how he seemed &quot;clean-cut&quot; and &quot;pleasant and courteous.&quot;

It makes me sad. It makes me sad because when we're at the mall, I can freely watch all the little ankle-biters playing on the toy train, running around and hollering, and I can smile at them and no one thinks twice. If a munchkin comes out of the train pit crying because she can't find her mom, I can scoop her up and take her to the mall security booth and no one really thinks twice about it.

Michael can't. (My Michael, I mean, not the article's Michael, of course.) Were he to sit on a bench by himself watching the kids play for an hour, he would be suspect. If he picked up that little girl and took her to the booth, people would watch him closely.

Is there any reason for people to be suspicious of him? Absolutely none. He adores children and would never allow one to be hurt, let alone hurt one himself. Will people be suspicious of him? Yes. And THAT makes me sad.

But I don't know that I can blame &lt;i&gt;unnecessary&lt;/i&gt; media fear-mongering for that. Maybe it's better in some way to live in a world where people watch Michael closely than where they ignore Joseph Duncan. Still...it makes me sad.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I probably should have added that the reason Shawn despises working with the news department down at the station is because most news stations have a policy of &quot;if it bleeds, it leads.&quot; Why? In large part because that's what the public watches. It's what draws people to your station. How many people watch the news daily--and how many more watch when a teaser is run about a car accident, or a kidnapping?

We get what we pay for, sometimes.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[&quot;&lt;em&gt;Sometimes it's best to err on the side of cautionâ€”or to at least keep one eye on people.&lt;/em&gt;&quot;

I agree that as a parent you should be keeping an eye on anyone that interacts with your kid. However, there is a play off between your rights to observe and another's rights to free expression and or lawful activities.

For example, it is lawful for a person to take pictures of groups of people or things in public places. To take away that persons rights because that person makes you uncomfortable is unlawful. What if your presence made someone uncomfortable? Would you feel that they had a right to have security remove you from a public park? Where do we draw the line?

If we live in a world where we cannot act if we might make some one else uncomfortable, then we will never be able to leave our homes and go out.

The emotional response is that we need to protect our children from all of the evils. The fact is that 99.9% of the people out there are not evil. We need to be vigilant, and try and spot those .1%, however we cannot start willy-nilly taking away rights from upstanding citizens because they &lt;em&gt;might be&lt;/em&gt; evil.

I heard &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.glennbeck.com/home/index-big.shtml&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Glen Beck&lt;/a&gt; saying that he felt it would be correct for the police to use torture in a case like that of Joseph Duncan, if they felt that he would give up information that might help rescue one of his victims. This is morally abhorrent! What if, and we have to consider this, Duncan was innocent? And we tortured him for nothing? Or what if he confessed under torture, and then was proven innocent?

Our legal system is predicated on fair treatment, assumption of innocence until proven otherwise, and blind justice. To start to cast people into stereotypes and take action based on those stereotypes is a dangerous road to travel. What about Wiccans? What if I felt that all Wiccans slaughtered goats under blue moons, and decided to have all Wiccans arrested?]]></wp:comment_content>

I agree with you there. I wasn't so much trying to make excuses or say that it's right to do so, as I was commenting that it's our natural instinct, it seems. We fight our instincts all the time, and this is one case where we should fight at least our inclination to overreact.]]></wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From the Too Stupid to be True? department</p>


	<p><a href="http://science.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/07/05/1422222&#038;from=rss">Slashdot </a> says:</p>


<blockquote><span class="caps">NASA</span>'s mission that sent a space probe smashing into a comet raised more than cosmic dust <del>- it also brought a lawsuit from a Russian astrologer. 'Bai is seeking damages totaling $300 million -</del> the approximate equivalent of the mission's cost-for her "moral sufferings," Izvestia said, citing her lawyer Alexander Molokhov. She earlier told the paper that the experiment would "deform her horoscope."'</blockquote>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/07/06/eu_bins_swpat/">EU The Register</a> says:</p>


<blockquote>The European Parliament has voted by a massive majority to reject the software patents directive, formally known as the Directive on the Patentability of Computer Implemented Inventions. The vote to scrap the bill was passed by a margin of 648 votes to 14, with 18 abstentions.</blockquote>

	<p>With the <a href="http://davejustus.blogspot.com/2005/06/file-sharing-networks-can-be-held.html">recent</a> issues in the US, this is a big win for the F/OSS folks. Way to go!</p>]]></content:encoded>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, I have been using the 'mini for several weeks. I am impressed. It's not a speed deamon, but it really 'gets r done!'.</p>


	<p>For example, I just got done putting together a short movie in iMovieHD - the file size is 9.5 gigs. It's about 40 min of video, pictures and music. It never slowed down. To be able to edit a 9.5 gig file with out a pause was really nice.</p>


	<p>Sheila was even able to jump in and play with the music transitions. So, here's the score.</p>


	<p>Plug in and get movies off camcorder - check.
Import movies into and out of iMovieHD - check.
Add pictures, music, titles and transitions - check.</p>


	<p>And all with out hitting help or google once.</p>


	<p>Pretty good!</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>British Prime Minister Tony Blair condemned on Thursday a "barbaric" series of attacks in London and said it was "reasonably clear" that terrorists were behind the wave of explosions.

	<p>Blair said he planned to leave a G8 summit of world leaders in Scotland in "the next couple of hours" and return to London, but he added that he would fly back to Gleneagles later in the day to re-join the talks.</p>


	<p>"It's reasonably clear there have been a series of terrorist attacks," a somber-looking Blair said in his first comment on a series of blasts that rocked London earlier on Thursday.</blockquote></p>


	<p>-<a href="http://wireservice.wired.com/wired/story.asp?section=Breaking&#38;storyId=1060229&#38;tw=wn_wire_story">Wired News</a></p>


<blockquote>Three explosions rocked the London subway and one tore open a packed double-decker bus during the morning rush hour Thursday. The blasts killed at least two people and reportedly injured more than 90 in what a shaken Prime Minister Tony Blair (video) said was a series of "barbaric" terrorist attacks.

	<p>Police reported "a number of fatalities" at one London subway station. "Things are still relatively confused," Superintendent John Morgan told reporters. </blockquote></p>

	<p>My heart goes out to the brave people in England. No one deserves this kind of thing, and it simply goes to show that we have a lot of work ahead.</p>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>It is hard for most people steeped in the humane, liberal values of Western Civilization to understand the massacre of innocents. To slaughter to make a political point. But terrorism is not likely to disappear. Indeed, it is a surprisingly common practice. Although Americans were taken unaware on September 11, many other peoples have long suffered from the murderous attention of domestic and foreign terrorists.

	<p>Terrorism is common, and will persist, because it is a tool of the weak versus the strong, a cheap military weapon to achieve expensive political goals. As long as there are people willing to kill to advance their ends, there will be terrorists.</blockquote></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>Today, an endless, recombinant, and fundamentally social process generates countless hours of creative product (another antique term?). To say that this poses a threat to the record industry is simply comic. The record industry, though it may not know it yet, has gone the way of the record. Instead, the recombinant (the bootleg, the remix, the mash-up) has become the characteristic pivot at the turn of our two centuries.</blockquote>

	<p>- <a href="http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/index.asp">William Gibson</a> in <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.07/gibson.html"><em>Wired</em></a></p>


	<p>Gibson has some great points in his article. To try and stop the flow of technology, culture and media away from objects and towards bits is like the print media trying to stop bloggers. It's just not going to happen. I have found podcasts that are simply mixes of music. The entire spectrum of media and entertainment are collapsing into a new digital medium that no one will have total control over. No matter how hard they try.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>So . . . the murderous thugs have done it again.

	<p>I don't think the English will be pushed around, though. I doubt they'll all go out and buy magnetic ribbons for their cars, and I really don't think they'll express their rage by renaming snack foods. But I won't be in the least surprised if, at street level, they are both angrier and more sensible about July 7 than we were about September 11. After all, the British have been bombed by a mass murderer before. They survived. They took the fight to the enemy. Other nations had the privilege of helping, but in England the free world made its stand, and came back to win. The murdering madman and his sycophants and his hirelings and his bombs and his poison gas and his mass graves are gone, and in their place is a decent nation that doesn't murder its own people or invade its neighbors.</p>


	<p>But it cost the free nations a lot of blood. Who can expect this war to be any different?</blockquote></p>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=3981">Cato</a> has a good article pointing out some reasons that schools should be private.</p>


<blockquote>In 1925, the Tennessee legislature passed a law forbidding teaching in public school "any theory that denies the story of divine creation of man as taught in the Bible." A young teacher, John T. Scopes, taught the theory of evolution in a high school biology class and was arrested for violating the new state law. Two famous lawyers, William Jennings Bryan and Clarence Darrow, came to the little town of Dayton to prosecute and defend Scopes. Their confrontation defined the clash between evolutionary theory and creationism, science and religion, for years to come.
<br />
How does this battle relate to school choice? It illustrates the problem with a one-size-fits-all monopoly school system. Lots of Tennesseans wanted their children taught the Biblical story of creation. But there were others, probably a minority, who wanted their children to learn the scientific consensus in biology class. Because the school system was a state monopoly, they could't both get what they wanted.</blockquote>

	<p>Do you want a committee to decide what you kids learn? What if the Liberals/NeoCons/Wacky Religious Nuts take over your school board? Why not allow folks to have choice in what their children learn?</p>


<blockquote>In a market system, customers can choose from a wide variety of options. Don't like steak? Eat at a vegetarian restaurant. Don't like traffic? Live in a bucolic neighborhood.
<br />
In a political system, like the school system, however, one group "wins," and the losers are stuck with products or services they don't like. Different preferences become the subject of endless political, legislative, and judicial squabbles.</blockquote>

	<p>When it comes to important things like my child's education, I really do not want to be "stuck with products or services they don't like". My child deserves to be educated in a way that my wife and I deem to be best - not a state run committee that panders to voters, special interests and the lowest common dominator.</p>


	<p>I also want my child to actually be challenged. Forget all of this pandering to test scores, slowing down the classes so that the slowest kids can keep up. I was in the public school system, and I did horribly - because I was bored off my asterisk.</p>


	<p>So, personally I want a few things for my child's schooling
<br /></p>


<li>A challenging and stimulating environment</li>
<li>An environment that stresses critical thinking over rote memorization. I have always hated the school of thought that requires kids to know in 1482 Columbus sailed the Ocean Blue, but not impart a understanding of the backdrop behind the event. I could care less exactly what year the 100 Years War started, but you bet your bippy I want to understand what caused it, the outcome, and what effects it had on the socio-political environment of the time</li>
<li>An environment that teaches tolerance, understanding, and social graces.</li>

	<p>That's a really tall order for the current crop of PC Public Schools. So, the kidlet will probably go to private schools, and we will pay out the nose for that privilege. All the while paying with taxes for everyone else's kids to go to sub-par public schools. It does not make sense, nor is it at all fair.</p>


	<p>Even if our tax monies are returned in the form of Vouchers, that would be a step in the right direction. The best solution all around would be for folks to not have to pay taxes for the running of these public schools, and rather spend that money on schooling for their children that they find acceptable.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<title>On Meditation and Reality</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>This is not some crummy 'meditate so you'll be nicer to peopleâ€ post. This isn't 'meditate so you'll be calmerâ€ post. This is 'meditate so you can escape verbal confinement and roam free in the universe.â€ Meditation as revolutionary politics, as anarchy, as Will and Life and Freedom. You know that your mind is a cage: that other people wrote the language you think in, that your conceptual frameworks were moulded first by your parents, then by your schools, then by Aleister Crowley, Bill Burroughs and Swami Shivananada. Everything in words is garbage, ever more confining and sophisticated traps to keep you in the realm of experience to which words can meaningfully refer.</blockquote>

	<p>Thus starts a very good article over at <a href="http://www.key23.net/occulture/archives/2005/07/08/detonating-the-mind-bomb-punk-rock-vedanta/">Key23</a>.</p>


	<p>I think that Bastart has some very good points.  What we see is a illusion, defined by our cultural context. I used to try and explain it like this:</p>


	<p>Reality is defined by two things. First off is our belief structure. What we believe defines our personal reality. Many people do not understand this. They feel that if they see it certain way, that everyone should agree with them. They do not understand that most of their beliefs are constructed by their own meme structure. The first step to freedom is to realize that others have different paradigms - and therefore different realities. They live in different worlds then we do.</p>


<blockquote>Most people think in terms of symbols and labels for the objects and relationships between the actual objects of reality. They take the "idea" to be the thing and work mentally with these concepts about the things of reality alone, usually paying little attention to how closely these concepts or ideas accurately relate to actual observable things.</blockquote>

	<p>- Reality, Belief and The Mind by <a href="http://www.sntp.net/essay1_2.htm">Gene Zimmer</a></p>


	<p>The second definer of reality is culture.  Everyone else's beliefs will impact your belief. It's like inertia. It's hard to change speed and direction when you are weighted down by everyone else's beliefs. Only by breaking the paradigm that your culture has installed into your mind, can you really see the universe for what it is. The second step to freedom is to free your mind from the background noise that exists all of the time. To quiet it, and allow your perceptions to work alone, so that you can see what is really happening, rather then what your meme complex says that is happening.</p>


	<p>This is the enlightenment that the Buddha spoke of. It's not super powers, or some spiritual transmogrification. Rather, it is a new way of seeing the universe. A way of seeing with out the baggage of thousands of years of memes and cruft that was passed down to you by your parents, your teachers, your pastors.</p>


	<p>To survive in this world, to find lasting happiness and peace, you must throw away the constructs that run rampant in the back of your mind - quiet them and allow reality to bubble to the front. Stop using symbols in your mind to define reality, but allow reality to define it's self.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>But there's another company that is breaking the Wal-Mart mold: Costco Wholesale Corp., now the fifth-largest retailer in the U.S. While Wal-Mart pays an average of $9.68 an hour, the average hourly wage of employees of the Issaquah, Wash.-based warehouse club operator is $16. After three years a typical full-time Costco worker makes about $42,000, and the company foots 92% of its workers? health insurance tab.

	<p>How does Costco pull it off? How can a discount retail chain pay middle-class wages and still bring in over $880 million in net revenues? And, a cynic may ask, with Wal-Mart wages becoming the norm, why does it bother?</blockquote></p>


	<pre><code>- <a href="http://www.laborresearch.org/print.php?id=391">The Costco Challenge: An Alternative to Wal-Martization?</a></code></pre>


	<p>Interesting read and well worth the time. I personally only shop at Wally-World when I know that I cannot get the item elsewhere, or when the price delta is large. We normally shop at Costco, so it's nice to see that they try and treat their employees so well. It really shows, the checkers at Costco seem to be somewhat happy to be there. Wally-world ones usually exude tiredness.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Comparing these two businesses seems to be apples and oranges to me.

Especially the average pay comparison.  Costo pretty much has it's presence in large towns and big cities, while Wal-Mart has a large pressence is small towns.  I expect that the 'average cost of living' for employees of the two chains is different as well.

It would seem more interesting, and more useful, to have a comparison between Wal-mart employees in Spokane (for example) and Costco emloyees in Spokane.  I expect, although I don't know for sure, that the numbers would be signifigantly closer.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.everyweek.com/Archives/News.asp?no=4608&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Independent&lt;/a&gt; did an article on this awhile back.

I don't think it's as much apples and oranges as you might think. Comparing the pay alone for the Missoula Wal-Mart versus the Missoula Costco supports the above articles. On top of that, wages aren't the only thing to be compared here; Costco simply treats their workers better.

If the &quot;cost of living&quot; were remotely accurate half the time, I could see more problems with the standing comparison methods. But until a &quot;living wage&quot; actually IS a living wage, I don't know that a 100% accurate comparison is possible.

Which reminds me, I need to go get a Costco card.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Tsyko, from another point of view the difference in CEO salaries isn't as much as it appears.  Lee Scott makes about .05% of Wallmart's net profits, Jim Sinegal makes .04% of Costco's profits.

Another way of looking at things of course would be if it is easier for a Walmart employee to afford shopping at Walmart on their salary than it is for a Costco employee to shop at Costco.  Costco is signifigantly more expensive than Walmart.

Becca:

I didn't see anything in the article you linked to that compares pay at the Missoula Costco to pay at the Missoula Walmart.

Regardless of what a 'living wage' may be, It is patently obvious that it costs more to live in Naples, California than it does to live in Naples, Georgia.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Sinegal makes 8.5 time the salary of the average worker, and Scott makes 56 times the salary of his average employee - $1.2 million in salary alone. If he were to cap his salary at Sinegal's 8.5 either he would need to take a pay cut to $178,500 or increase his employees salarys to $141,000 a year. Thats about $54 an hour - more then you and I make. If we were to include his total income from bonus etc he would be taking home well over $10 million a year. - over 500 times the salary of his average employee.

That's just sick.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I have never seen the relevance of comparing a CEOs salary to an average workers salary.

Walmart is a much bigger company than Costco, hence I would expect that the leader of that company to make more money.

Lee Scott may well be overpaid.  But you can't tell that at all from how much he makes compared to how much an average Wallmart employee makes.  The proper question to ask is, does Wallmart as a company gain from the relationship.  If Wallmart get more out of Scott than they give him (and if they couldn't get the same performance by someone else for cheaper) than he is being appropriately compensated.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[How invested in a companies success can an average worker really be, when they see the top 1% of that company making hundreds of times what they make?

Not only that, but couple that with getting paid a wage that is barely a survival wage.

Here is the rub for me - People have a right to decide for themselves how to pay in their companies. However, the point of this is that a more humane approach to salary structure can work, and effecently. Costco is doing a bang up job - and turning quite a profit. Yes, if they cut wages they could turn a higher profit - but at what long term expense?

I wonder how much Wally World spends on PR and Spin Control about exactly these issues. If the CEO would forgoe his yearly bonus - and started to pay their employees a few dollars an hour more, how much would they save in the long run not having to fight this battle? Heck - if all of the 'C' level executives would cut their salary in half - they could probally afford to give their employees a large increase.

But - they have the freedom to run their company however they see fit. And I have the freedom to bitch about it, and choose to not shop there.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[My point is that the two issues, CEO pay and average employee pay are not connected.

It is certainly possible that Scott deserves every penny he makes AND Walmart employees should be paid more.  If employee disatisfaction is costing the company more than giving them a raise which would reduce that disatisfaction then yes, Walmart should pay more.

Personnaly, I don't like shopping at either Walmart or Costco.  Wallmart simply tends to have too many screaming kids and crowds of shoppers while Costco's ambiance certainly leaves something to be desired (not to mention the usual long lines for checkout)]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[They are not unrelated. Together, they form part of the corprate culture. If you look at your measly pay check and know the execs are taking home millions, you will be less happy then if you look at your measly check and realise that the execs are also tightening their belts or what have you.

Over compensated execs engender an Us vs Them managment style. Execs that are compensated in the same realm as their workers engender a team enviroment.

Beyond the culture, there is no linkage between what any two people make at a company. This is one of the reasons that it is usally an offence to discuss your wage in the private sector. In the public sector, everyone's wages are posted - you know what every one else makes.

It's all about Happy Workers, and promoting a culture where workers are productive, effective and motivated. Wallmart seems to not really motivate workers to do their best, rather they do what it takes to get buy.

Prices and shopping experince being equal, most people would rather shop somewhere with happy workers then some place with unhappy workers.]]></wp:comment_content>

We are (and should be) a free socity - and companies should be allowed to do business as they see fit. However, I have a feeling that Wally World is going to see a backlash from their practices, as Microsoft is going through right now.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[It really is Wal-Mart on a whole that I object to; their pay, their business practices, etc.

Several years ago, our local Wal-Mart wanted a zoning exemption to modify their existing S. Brooks store into a Super Wal-Mart. It was rejected. They tried again in 2002; rejected again. They got permission to build a brand new store, a Super Wal-Mart, on N. Reserve, in a spot that has created more traffic havoc than you could possibly imagine. They were permitted to do so because their applications for the S. Brooks store were turned down; the whole reason they were allowed to build the Super Wal-Mart in such a crappy (for traffic flow) spot was to &quot;compensate&quot; them for the zoning rejections.

Well, guess who's filing a third application, next week most likely, to re-zone the S. Brooks location for a Super Wal-Mart.

Bleh.]]></wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It seems that some other folks are starting to 'get it'. <a href="http://greg.nokes.name/index.php?s=memes&#38;submit=Search">Toxic Memes</a> are the most dangerous threat to our race of all time.</p>


<blockquote>It seems that what we're dealing with here is something far more elusive than a shadowy and sinister organization. It's an idea, a particularly virulent viral meme. It seeds itself via websites and chat rooms, is nurtured and grown in the soil of hate and disenfranchisement and eventually kills it's host. Trying to fight this idea with guns, arrests and an 'US' against 'THEM' dichotomy is stupid, pointless and just produces more mental fertilizer for the idea to grow in. The only way to fight ideas is through other ideas. Ideological antibiotics, administered through the opening of dialogue between communities, breaking down boundaries instead of setting them up and nurturing more beneficial strains of meme.</blockquote>

	<p>- <a href="http://www.donotthinkofablueelephant.co.uk/"> do not think of a blue elephant</a></p>


	<p>Changing the meme structure of these people is a hard row to hoe.</p>


<blockquote>I wish I knew a sure fire silver bullet that would end Islamism. My bet is that the answer is accountable, democratic governments in the Middle East, but that is admittedly just a guess at this point.</blockquote>

	<p>- <a href="http://davejustus.blogspot.com/2005/07/some-democrats-get-it.html">Justus</a></p>


	<p>I think that this is a good start. Free societies tend to breed people that believe in tolerance more then death - more positive Memes if you will.</p>


	<p>However, this is just the start. This problem has been brewing since Biblical times. It's not going to end anytime soon.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>Osama bin Laden's standing has dropped significantly in some key Muslim countries, while support for suicide bombings and other acts of violence has "declined dramatically," according to a new survey released today.

	<p>In a striking finding, predominantly Muslim populations in a sampling of six North African, Middle East and Asian countries are also as alarmed as Western nations about Islamic extremism, which is now seen as a threat in their own nations too, the poll found.</p>


	<p>"Most Muslim publics are expressing less support for terrorism than in the past. Confidence in Osama bin Laden has declined markedly in some countries, and fewer believe suicide bombings that target civilians are justified in the defense of Islam," concluded the Pew Global Attitudes Project.</blockquote></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Would there be a universe with out a consciousness to measure it? In physics we see that the act of observing something changes that something. For example, we can measure a particle for it's speed, or it's location - not both. The more exactly we discern it's location, the less we can tell about it's speed. If we know that Right Now, it's Right Here, we cannot determine it's velocity nor direction of travel.</p>


<blockquote>Cosmology, is the study of the universe in its totality and by extension man's place in it. Though the word cosmology is itself of fairly modern origin, first penned in Wolff's Cosmologia Generalis (1730), the study of the universe has a long history involving science, philosophy, and religion</blockquote>

	<p>-<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology">Wikipedia</a></p>


	<p>I think that life is like that. We either know where we are, or where we are going. And, this is not a bad thing. We need to really concentrate on what is important to us now. Where we are.  It's like this - if we get all frazzled and worried about the endgame before we get the ball - how do you think that we will do when we get the ball?</p>


	<p>Not well. We need to keep our eyes and thoughts on what we are doing right now. For example, when one is 'looking' one rarely finds a mate. When one is comfortable in our own skins, and do not need some one to complete us, that is when we are ready to settle down.</p>


<blockquote>Mindfulness is the practice whereby a person is intentionally aware of his or her thoughts and actions in the present moment, non-judgmentally. Largely associated with Buddhism, in which it is called sati, the practice of mindfulness is also advocated by such people as medical researcher and author Dr. Jon Kabat-Zinn, psychologist Nathaniel Branden and philosopher Ayn Rand. </blockquote>

	<p>-<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindfulness">Wikipedia</a></p>


	<p>Moving to a slower beat, watching each step that we make, being mindful, that is what will get us to the endgame.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I don't agree with that.  While I certainly think one can over-focus on one's plans and one's future and that it is important to live in the present, not having plans or goals isn't the answer either.

It is vital that we fully understand and embrace where we are, and what we are currently, but the greatest gift of humanity, the thing that seperates us from other animals, is the ability to see beyond what is to what could be.

Our science and technological advancements, as well as our art and culture, were built by those who were disatisfied with the 'now' and imagined a better world, something more.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I agree - it's not to not have goals and plans, but rather to not stress about future events.

For example - if you want a big screen TV, the best thing to do is to save a small amount each month, and when you have the money, to get it, and not to stress out over it. That is responsible planning.

It is not wise to focus your entire life onto getting that TV - putting aside so much that your other bills fall behind, all the while lusting over the TV, visiting it each day etc, etc.

Working to make a better world is a very laudable goal - however trying to effect the future with out a stable grounding in the now is not easy, nor is it liable to make good changes.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I think everyone would agree that to focus a life on getting a TV is unhealthy.  However, focusing one's entire life on a TV that one already has isn't any better.

What about someone who focuses their entire life on curing cancer?  Someone who abandons their family and friends for this all consuming goal...

Assuming they succeed, would it be worth it?

Probably it would not be worth it to me (I tend to be in the focus my life on the TV that I have camp anyway) but I would be grateful to anyone who made that decision.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I don't agree.  Usually at the pinacle of success in any field are people who most definately do not have a balanced view of life and focus obsessively on their goals.

Granted, they have to realistically understand their present situation, as far as it relates to their goals, but being comfortable in their own skin and living for the now are not ways I would describe such highly motivated and competitive people.

I don't know that this makes them happy, but I think we would all be poorer for not having this type of person in the world.]]></wp:comment_content>

But, what is the endgame that I spoke of in the article? Is is faster and faster growth of knowledge? Is is being the best in your feild at the expense of family, life and sanity? Or is it moderation in all things. Being very focused on everything that you do - focused on work at work, on family with family. Being mindful of what you do.]]></wp:comment_content>

<title>The Magical Curtain</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>In my day job I work with mostly Windows users and I'm often asked how to go about doing this or that on a Mac. Frequently such questions are followed up with the statement, â€ So why doesn't it work like Windows?â€

	<p>I starting thinking the other day that here lies a great irony of technology. The irony that because so many PC users spend so much time in the dark trying to figure out what's going on behind the magical curtain that is Windows, they automatically assume that using a Mac would be just as confusing. Many never decide to switch because they feel they'd have to learn that awful process all over again. Take the process of uninstalling applications for exampleâ€¦</p>


	<p>Windows: Start menu -&gt; Control Panels -&gt; Add/Remove Programs -&gt; scroll to application you want to remove -&gt; click Remove -&gt; click Yes to confirm.</p>


	<p>Mac: Select the application you want to remove on your computer -&gt; drag it to the trash.</p>


	<p>My point?</p>


	<p><em> The difference between Windows and Mac OS is the difference between a process so complex that it requires a separate process to manage (Windows) versus a process specifically designed from the beginning to be intuitive enough that it just makes sense (Mac).</em></p>


	<p>Technology is complex enough in its own right, the beauty of the Mac is that someone, somewhere actually knew that and went out of their way to make easier on the rest of us.</p>


	<p>Who needs a curtain anyway?</blockquote></p>


	<p>-<a href="http://education.apple.com/students/blog/index.php/archives/2005/04/05/">Clif</a> at the Apple Student Blog
<br />
How to install a program on mac (like <a href="http://www.bzflag.org">BZFlag</a>):</p>


	<p>1) Download
2) Open File
3) Drag app to a folder. Apps folder is probally a good choice, since you will then know where to find it</p>


	<p>That's it. As the quote above says, to uninstall it, you find it, and drag it to the trash. No problems. Very Easy.</p>


	<p>I love Linux - and the total control it gives me over my system. I like distros like <a href="http://www.archlinux.org">ArchLinux</a> for that simple fact. I can look at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemon_%28computer_software%29">daemons</a> that are running and know what each one does, why it is running, and recall when I installed it.</p>


	<p>However, when I am at home, I just want the bloody thing to work, and work with out thought. So, my lappy and my workstation are Macs, and my server is (being built as) ArchLinux.</p>]]></content:encoded>

	<p>Speaking of flying, watched the <a href="http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/050726_sts114_launchsuccess.html">Shuttle</a> today. Really great that we are making it back into space. I hope that the crew makes it back home safely, with all their science and tasks done safely, and easily.</p>


	<p>I really loved the signs that <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Soichi+Noguchi&#38;sourceid=mozilla-search&#38;start=0&#38;start=0&#38;ie=utf-8&#38;oe=utf-8&#38;client=firefox&#38;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:unofficial">Soichi Noguchi</a> came up with - if you missed them they were a hoot!</p>


	<p>It's sad, but I think that the Columbia Disaster has brough more awareness back <span class="caps">NASA</span> and the manned missions. In the shuttle's heyday, they did not even broadcast the launches. Now, they certainly did broadcast, and give a good blow by blow.</p>


	<p>Speaking of which, did you see the 'fuel tank cam' shot when the shuttle seperated from the main tank? Wow.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>America is now threatened less by conquering states than we are by failing ones. That was the conclusion of the 2002 U.S. National Security Strategy. For a country whose foreign policy in the 20th century was dominated by the struggles against powerful states such as Germany, Japan, and the Soviet Union, the U.S. assessment is striking. Nor is the United States alone in diagnosing the problem. U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has warned that ignoring failed states creates problems that sometimes come back to bite us. French President Jacques Chirac has spoken of the threat that failed states carry for the world's equilibrium. World leaders once worried about who was amassing power; now they worry about the absence of it.</blockquote>
- <a href="http://davejustus.blogspot.com/">Justus</a>

It’s interesting how our foreign policy’s success has now turned on us.

For example – Most of the former <span class="caps">USSR</span> is shown as ‘borderline’ or worse on the map provided. Many of the battlegrounds of the cold war are probably worse off for the wear.

The choices made in the past effect us now. It does us no good to second guess what we did – but we should look at the results and see what our aggressive and expansionistic policies  have reaped.

I agree that the destabilized areas of the world are where trouble is going to brew. In this day and age, when the US alone out spends the entire world in military spending (notice how they call it defense spending? What is up with that? If we spend more on our defense then everyone else put together, are we paranoid?) no one can stand toe to toe with us anymore. There is no battlefield that any one (or two or ten) country can defeat us on.

So, people who rebel against our mass-marketed culture take to the back alleys, the coffee shops. The meet and talk, and the really whacked out ones strap bombs on and blow themselves up in pointless gestures of defiance and misplaced rage.

The suicide bombers worry me – but the smart ones scare me. The ones that are actively plotting to destroy our culture and, it seems at times, are winning. These are the ones that talk the whacked out ones into their path of destruction. The Imams and Clerics that preach the radicalized version of Islam. The ones that create and spread the really toxic memes.

I believe that violence will only beget more violence. I do not think that guns will solve this – talking will. But how do you convince some one that thinks your entire belief system and way of live is a puss-filled ulcer on a otherwise godly earth that they are wrong? How do you teach them tolerance? Can you? Should you even try, or should you just take the short term solution, the quick fix?

I do not pretend to have the answer to these questions. I question our current policy, however I do not have any better ideas. Talking is not an option, as they believe that we will simple lie to them. Money is not an option, as many of them come from well off families.

There are no easy solutions.]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Despite the danger of failed states, I still think we are better off with the end of the Soviet Union.

While we are probably more in danger of a nuclear attack now, we are much less in danger of a nuclear war that renders the planet unlivable.  That was a real possibility during the cold war, indeed I remember believing it was a 'when' not an 'if'.

I also don't think it is a rebellion against our 'mass market culture' I think the rebellion is different, both more complex and simpler than that.

I also don't agree that violence never solves anything.  Historically violence has in fact solved a whole lot of things.

I hope that this can be solved without extreme violence.  My faith in that is the Muslim people taking control of their destiny and wresting their faith back from the radicals who have claimed it.  To do so though, they need time and space and our Military can give them that.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I totally agree that we are better off with the end of the cold war. The end of the USSR? I do not know. It's hard to say - but they certainly kept their region stable. I do not have a plan that would have worked, but I think that anytime we look at the collapse of a large state, like the USSR or Rome, we look at some very interesting times. Interesting times not really being what we want to have happen.

As to the mass market consumerism - there was a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2005/07/23/npoll23.xml&amp;amp;sSheet=/news/2005/07/23/ixnewstop.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;poll&lt;/a&gt; done in Britain recently (after 7/7/05) that shows

&lt;blockquote&gt;nearly a third of British Muslims, 32 per cent, are far more censorious, believing that &quot;Western society is decadent and immoral and that Muslims should seek to bring it to an end&quot;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This is not a war of bullets and guns and bombs - they are simply the tools. This is a war of ideas and ideology. What culture will survive on into the 22nd century.

Every time we drop a bomb, or kill a muslim, more of them start to swing towards radicalism. Only they can stop it. But how do we convince them that they need to? That is the question that will win this 'war'.

But, if given the choice between the lives of innocents and a suicide bomber, I would protect the bystanders. I think that this is the greatest challenge that faces us. This is the challenge that will make our generation the greatest in American history, or the ones that lost it all.

How do you protect yourself against people that are willing to use random force and die in the process, with out further alienating his peers?

If we look at Israel and the Palestinians - every time one side kills some one on the other side, the other side decides that they need to exact retribution, and kill someone. Ever escalating cycle of death.]]></wp:comment_content>

Pretty much the entire religious right and the entire left feel that way.

It seems surprising that so few British Muslims agree.]]></wp:comment_content>

You like things edgy, subtle, and smart. I guess that means you're probably an intellectual, but don't take that  to mean you're pretentious. You realize 'dumb' can be witty-<del>after all isn't that the Simpsons' philosophy?</del>-but  rudeness for its own sake, 'gross-out' humor and most other things found in a fraternity leave you totally flat. <br /><br />I  guess you just have a more cerebral approach than most. You have the perfect mindset for a joke writer or staff  writer. Your sense of humor takes the most effort to appreciate, but it's also the best, in my opinion.</td></tr></tbody></table></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://emilyscraziness.blogspot.com/2005/07/politics-kind-of.html">Emily</a> had this to say</p>


<blockquote>One thing I don't understand is how generally intelligent people (sorry if you're offended, Brando, but this really did bother me) can get sucked into conspiracy theories, etc., spouting rumors about Bush being evil and about government really being just a front for powerful people to get what they want.</blockquote>

	<p>About this <a href="http://leahytome.blogspot.com/2005/07/sour-taste-in-my-mouth.html">article</a></p>


<blockquote>lets start with the first: Bush and Regan are utterly evil. This is also backed up with the subclause that their stupidity not only makes me brain wavier on the edge of an anureism, but is frightening because of the power that they, and (mostly) their cohorts wield.</blockquote>

	<p>I must say, that this article bothered me as well. Perhaps not for the same reasons that Emily was - More on that later - it's really late!</p>


	<p>This is my response, in a Comment on Emily's site.</p>


	<p>Evil is only really evil in it's opponents eyes. For example. I feel that Hitler might have been 'evil'. However, if you were to ask him, I doubt that he would have though of himself as 'evil'. Only really really sick people think of themselves as evil.</p>


	<p>It's a case of understanding what underlying motivations cause actions. Sane people do not tend to simply cause harm to others for no apparent reason. Only sick people do this.</p>


	<p>Please note - by these statements I in no way condone immoral or wrong actions. Sickness is not an excuse. By trying to understand these people, and their motivations, perhaps we can approach an understanding of them, how to help them better, and how to help society deal with them.</p>


	<p>This world is not one of black and white absolutes, but rather of shades of grey. People tend to try and do the best that they can to achieve their aims. When we elect some one, we hope that their aims are close to ours.</p>


	<p>To look at President Reagan or President Bush and declare him to be the possessor of some dark and absolute evil? That is a very childish world view. In the realm of humanity, there is no such thing as pure evil. There is, of course, sickness and putrid wrongness, but evil? That's just silly. There is no such thing.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>The case for intelligent design

	<p>What is Intelligent Design? Many scientists <del>- well, nearly all scientists -</del> seem surprised that the President of the United States thinks Intelligent Design should be taught in schools. (See today's news reports about that by Fox News and others.) Most likely, the President is referring to the persuasive 1998 report prepared by J.J. Rivera of Sandia National Laboratories:</p>


	<pre><code>Design engineers are becoming few in number and years worth of experience is about to be lost. What will happen when new weapons are designed or retrofits need to be made? Who will know the lessons learned in the past? What process will be followed? When and what software codes should be used? Intelligent design is the answer to the questions posed above for weapon design.</code></pre>


	<p>The report is titled "Intelligent design using expertise knowledge, manufacturing data, and legacy codes." Its final section, labeled "CONCLUSIONS," says:</p>


	<pre><code>The intelligent designer is still being developed.</blockquote></code></pre>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have been working on a quick and dirty backup script to backup a MySQL database and several directories. Here is the fruit of my labor</p>


<h1>change dir to backup dir</h1>

	<p>cd /backup</p>



<h1>build next days worth of file backups</h1>

	<p>rm -rf /backup/backup.4
mv /backup/backup.3 /backup/backup.4
mv /backup/backup.2 /backup/backup.3
mv /backup/backup.1 /backup/backup.2
cp -al /backup/backup.0 /backup/backup.1
rsync -a-delete /srv/ /backup/backup.0/</p>



<h1>Backup etc</h1>

	<p>tar -cvf etc.tar /etc
rm /backup/etc.tar.gz
gzip etc.tar</p>



<h1>backup MySQL databases</h1>

	<p>rm /backup/backup4.sql
mv /backup/backup3.sql /backup/backup4.sql
mv /backup/backup2.sql /backup/backup3.sql
mv /backup/backup1.sql /backup/backup2.sql
mv /backup/backup.sql  /backup/backup1.sql
mysqldump-all-databases &gt;/backup/backup.sql</p>



<h1>Make 1 compressed tarball of entire shebang</h1>

	<p>rm /backup/backup.tar.gz
tar -cvf /backup.tar /backup/*
mv /backup.tar /backup
gzip /backup/backup.tar</p>



<h1>Move backups offsite</h1>

	<p>ncftpput -u <em>username</em> -p <em>password</em> <em>servername</em> <em>target_directory</em> /backup/backup.tar.gz</p>



	<p>All of this assumes that you have a directory called 'backup' off the root of the file system that you can use for moving stuff about. It will provide you with 5 complete days of full file backups (in the space of 1, plus changes), 5 full days of MySQL backups and a daily snapshot of the /etc/ directory for what ever reason.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our history is chock full of some gut-wrenching atrocities that have been committed in the name of various gods. Does this bring us closer to the Kingdom of Heaven? Nirvana? WallyWorld?</p>


	<p>I would say no. In fact, I would say that violence should never be used aggressively. Self Defense is one thing, but going out and killing others for no good reason? Or, even for a good reason?</p>


	<p>If we assume that a stepping stone on the path to WallyWorld is a world where peace reigns, then we can look at every aggressive act as moving us further away from WallyWorld. When you are aggressively violent, and even when you are defensively violent, you do more then just hurt some one's body, you damage the psyche of the community. Looking at 9/11, the people that did that were horrid people. They scarred the Americans collective psyche for generations to come. We are still dealing with the ramification of this. The Patriot Act, the War Hawks, the extreme split between the Right and Left.</p>


	<p>A small percentage of us shouted for revenge! We wanted the people responsible dead. A larger percentage of us shouted for Justice! We wanted to see the perpetrators brought to justice. Another group of us shouted for, well, nothing. To hide and hope that it would not happen again.</p>


	<p>My feelings at the time ranged from Revenge to Justice. But, the point is that there is an equal and opposite reaction for every action. That is what the Terrorists see, and count on. Look at the shooting today in <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/upi/?feed=TopNews&#38;article=UPI-1-20050804-18415500-bc-israel-bus-1stld.xml">Gaza</a>. They count on the fact that the targets will become enraged, and topple the peace process.</p>


<blockquote>With the notion that "to kill an infidel is not murder - it's the path to heaven", there was the prevalent concept that heaven can be won through putting non-believers through "hell", which they are deemed to deserve. But how can anyone be rewarded karmically through acts of hateful violence? "God wills it!" is uttered as a war cry throughout the film, but it is obvious in many instances that it was the deluded men themselves, who willed what they did, while the gods themselves remain ominously silent. It forces the audience to question how much were they fighting for God and how much for themselves, to covet land and wealth. Grave ungodliness in the name of God?</blockquote>

	<p>- <a href="http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/index.php?id=12,1178,0,0,1,0">Can the Elusive "Kingdom of Heaven" be Fought For?</a> about the movie <a href="http://www.kingdomofheavenmovie.com">Kingdom of Heaven</a></p>


	<p>If God is in fact a God of Love, then how can people even think that he would have us make war on each other, and maim, torture and kill each other <em>in his name</em>? I believe very strongly that acts of war, torture and what have you are in fact not divine in origin, rather are man made, and God is simply used as convenient rationalization. I believe that if God is still watching over us, if there is a God, he/she/it is disgusted.</p>


	<p>More then that: Entrance into WallyWorld is predicated on a certain behavioral standard. It is rare to see such a standard which includes mass murder. In the Buddhist philosophy, each negative act garners you bad karma. Any bad karma that you have, must be worked off before you can reach the level of calm that enlightenment requires. So, the mass murderers probably will not attain WallyWorld any time soon.</p>


	<p>The question of self defense has often bothered me. As a Buddhist, if I am attacked, am I simply to stand and die? If my Family is attacked, am I just to watch in horror? That is where I draw the line. I am a pacifist. I do not think that killing or violence is a good answer to any question. However, when force is brought to the table, I will respond in a fashion that will assure the safety of me and mine.</p>


	<p>I have a very high level of respect for the Police Officers and Solders in this world. Most do an outstanding job of taking the community on as 'family' and protecting them all. The eventual answer to violence will be two pronged. First we have to assure that the misguided people who think that they can initiate violence to get what they want are stopped cold. We also need to be able to teach a lifestyle of tolerance, and peaceful response to stress.</p>


	<p>This War on Terror will not be won with bullets and bombs - if you consider winning to be a more peaceful world. However, those bullets and bombs just might buy us the time to engage in the discussion and diplomacy that <em>will</em> win the war.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[&quot;First we have to assure that the misguided people who think that they can initiate violence to get what they want are stopped cold.&quot;

I think that this is critical.  Being peaceful and non-aggressive is all well and good, but when it crosses into excusing and failing to confront evil, it is no longer noble.  When possible, stopping the bad guys without using violence is great, but the bad guys will use violence, and if the good guys won't use violence to stop them, the bad guys will win.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I am pretty sure we agree, at least more than not on this.

Certainly unless one is willing to advocate a 'final solution' violence alone will not solve this problem (and that solution would be worse than our current problems.)

However, many use reasoning like that presented in your post (albeit without the caveat of violence being needed to buy us time) as a means of supporting the notion that violence itself is wrong, even in deffence or for the protection of others.  That type of reasoning, in my belief, is as much, perhaps more, guilty of allowing atrocities as any religious beliefs.

When good men feel that being good means not opposing evil, they are allowing evil to flourish.]]></wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><strong><span class="caps">OPEN LETTER TO KANSAS SCHOOL BOARD</span></strong>

	<p>I am writing you with much concern after having read of your hearing to decide whether the alternative theory of Intelligent Design should be taught along with the theory of Evolution. I think we can all agree that it is important for students to hear multiple viewpoints so they can choose for themselves the theory that makes the most sense to them. I am concerned, however, that students will only hear one theory of Intelligent Design.</blockquote></p>


	<p>You really should read the rest of <a href="http://www.venganza.org/index.htm">this</a>. It's an example of how one person can really make a difference. It brought tears to my eyes. It's people like this that really make a diffrence.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>Joe said: I see a building, and I can recognize that it was created by some intelligence, for some purpose. I may not know how it was built, or for what purpose, but the form and symmetry and structure (the sides are plumb and level, etc.) tell me it was created by intelligent design, and not a random occurance of stone and glass.

	<p>I answered: Setting aside the strawman nature of this analogy, imagine two men confronted with this building. One devotes his life to methodically studying what it's made of and how it was built. The other guy sacrifices a goat in front of it once a month.</p>


	<p>If you went to these men and asked them what they knew about the building, the first guy would show you his notes, explain his methods, and present the evidence for his claims. The second guy would ask if you had any spare goats.</p>


	<p>Intelligent Design is what you get when the second guy pretends to adopt the methods and terminology of the first in order to talk you out of your goats.</blockquote></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you are like me, you often need a tool, like shutgui.exe. Now, you can pay some bucks to Microsoft to get their Resource Kit (a big book and a cd) - or you can go here: <a href="http://www.petri.co.il/download_free_reskit_tools.htm">Download Free Windows 2000 Resource Kit Tools</a> to get them. It's a life saver.</p>


	<p><em>use these tools at your own risk. most can really wonk up your computer if used incorrectly. It can be hard to figure out how to use these correctly, so buyer beware! In other words, if you wonk your computer up by playing with these, expect only laughter from me</em> :)</p>]]></content:encoded>

The dose of fluoride cannot be controlled. Fluoride as a drug has contaminated most processed foods and beverages throughout North America. Individuals who are susceptible to fluoride's harmful effects cannot avoid ingesting this drug. This presents a medico-legal and ethical dilemma and sets water fluoridation apart from vaccination as a public health measure where doses and distribution can be controlled. The rights of individuals to enjoy the freedom from involuntary fluoride medication certainly outweigh the right of society to enforce this public health measure, especially when the evidence of benefit is marginal at best.</blockquote>

<blockquote>John Robideaux, chairman of Fluoridation Works, said his organization has not given up its effort to introduce fluoride into Spokane water and may mount another petition drive in the spring.</blockquote>

	<p>I guess that my major concern with this is that I will have to pay for something that not only do I not want, but that I will have to take more action to rid my self off. So, if this passes, they are going to charge me to put this stuff into the water, and then I will have to pay to get it removed again.</p>


	<p>Sucks to be me if this actually makes it, right?</p>


	<p>Why not let people choose? If I want to fluoride my self and my kid, let ME make that choice.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>Since the London bombings, there has been a lot of discussion about profiling. To help, here is what I wrote on the subject in "Beyond Fear" (pp. 133-7):

	<p>"Good security has people in charge. People are resilient. People can improvise. People can be creative. People can develop on-the-spot solutions. People can detect attackers who cheat, and can attempt to maintain security despite the cheating. People can detect passive failures and attempt to recover. People are the strongest point in a security process. When a security system succeeds in the face of a new or coordinated or devastating attack, it's usually due to the efforts of people.</blockquote></p>


	<p>and</p>


<blockquote>Despite what many people think, terrorism is not confined to young Arab males. Shoe-bomber Richard Reid was British. Germaine Lindsay, one of the 7/7 London bombers, was Afro-Caribbean. Here are some more examples from a speech by the U.S. Secretary of Transportation Norman Mineta:

	<p>"In 1986, a 32-year-old Irish woman, pregnant at the time, was about to board an El Al flight from London to Tel Aviv when El Al security agents discovered an explosive device hidden in the false bottom of her bag. The woman's boyfriend <del>- the father of her unborn child -</del> had hidden the bomb.</p>


	<p>"In 1987, a 70-year-old man and a 25-year-old woman <del>- neither of whom were Middle Eastern -</del> posed as father and daughter and brought a bomb aboard a Korean Air flight from Baghdad to Thailand. En route to Bangkok, the bomb exploded, killing all on board.</p>


	<p>"In 1999, men dressed as businessmen (and one dressed as a Catholic priest) turned out to be terrorist hijackers, who forced an Avianca flight to divert to an airstrip in Colombia, where some passengers were held as hostages for more than a year and a half."</p>


	<p>The 2002 Bali terrorists were Indonesian. The Chechnyan terrorists who downed the Russian planes were women. Timothy McVeigh and the Unabomber were Americans. The Basque terrorists are Basque, and Irish terrorists are Irish. The Tamil Tigers are Sri Lankan.</p>


	<p>And many Muslims are not Arabs. Even worse, almost everyone who is Arab is not a terrorist <del>- many people who look Arab are not even Muslims. So not only are there an large number of false negatives -</del> terrorists who don't meet the profile-but there an enormous number of false positives: innocents that do meet the profile. </blockquote></p>


	<p>-The <a href="http://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram-0508.html#1">Crytpo-Gram</a> by <a href="http://www.schneier.com/">Bruce Schneier</a></p>


	<p>Profiling - if done properly is a <strong>good</strong> thing. It's when we start doing it incorrectly that we run into problems. I think that we need to realize it's benefits and, and train folks how to legally and effectively profile. Point in fact, I think that we all already do.</p>


<blockquote>Everyone does it all the time. When you see someone lurking in a dark alley and change your direction to avoid him, you're profiling. When a storeowner sees someone furtively looking around as she fiddles inside her jacket, that storeowner is profiling. People profile based on someone's dress, mannerisms, tone of voice ... and yes, also on their race and ethnicity. When you see someone running toward you on the street with a bloody ax, you don't know for sure that he's a crazed ax murderer. Perhaps he's a butcher who's actually running after the person next to you to give her the change she forgot. But you're going to make a guess one way or another. That guess is an example of profiling.</blockquote>

	<p>So, by looking at a situation, evaluating the possible risk and acting with out first getting conformation that the threat is real, well, you are a profiler. You dirty bad guy. :)</p>


	<p>I wish that we lived in a world were we all acted with pure motives, no one ever hurt anyone else - and making personal security decisions based on gut instinct was not needed. But we do not. So, we have to use the tools at hand. Our gut is one of the best tools that we have, as long as we are not consumed by terror and fear of imaginary bad guys behind every corner.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>When we debunk a fanatical faith or prejudice, we do not strike at the root of fanaticism. We merely prevent its leaking out at a certain point, with the likely result that it will leak out at some other point. Thus by denigrating prevailing beliefs and loyalties, the militant man of words unwittingly creates in the disillusioned masses a hunger for faith. For the majority of people cannot endure the barrenness and futility of their lives unless they have some ardent dedication, or some passionate pursuit in which they can lose themselves. Thus, in spite of himself, the scoffing man of words becomes the precursor of a new faith.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Crawford Tx. , Thousands of people gathered today to try to catch a glimpse of a grilled cheese sandwich that supposedly sported the likeness of Mother Sheehan, the Patron Saint of Left Causes. Mrs. Sheehan is grieving her lost son Casey, who was killed in combat after apparently being forced to volunteer for military duty, and currently camping near President Bush's vacation ranch to protest the war. Grilled to perfectionMrs. Sheehan was recently bestowed the highest honor the Left can give: Victim. </blockquote>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>In the U.S. public education system, this assumption is dead wrong. There total expenditures are allocated from the top down to mop up available revenues. How much any public school spends depends not on how much it "needs" for efficient operation but on how much it can extract from taxpayers. These revenues are then dissipated among various squabbling constituencies to feed their continuous demand for public funds.

	<p>In the topsy-turvy world of public education, the incentive is for efficient, low-cost schools to imitate the less efficient, high-cost schools by spending more. The result is that U.S. public education is greatly over-funded. Public school per-pupil costs are roughly 40 to 45 percent higher than those of private schools. When we take into account the larger number of private elementary schools and further adjust for special ed, the difference narrows to about 36 percent.</blockquote></p>

	<p>And, might I add that private schools tend to be better at educating their their public counterparts? And, why am I paying to put my neighboors kids though this?</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><span class="caps">CNN</span> reported a worm outbreak this afternoon involving their network, ABCNews, NYTimes, as well as Capitol Hill.

	<p>Information is still flowing on this situation, but here's what we have so far:</p>


	<p>Symantec just released info on the <span class="caps">W32</span>.Zotob.E worm here.</p>


	<p>Trend Micro also released information under <span class="caps">WORM</span>_RBOT.CBQ.</p>


	<p>McAfee released information as well: <span class="caps">W32</span>/IRCbot.worm</p>


	<p>This is an <span class="caps">IRC</span> bot worm, and will scan for <span class="caps">TCP</span> port 445, and for file shares. McAfee reports in it's bulletin that systems not patched for <span class="caps">MS05</span>-039 will continually reboot.</p>


	<p>It exploits known vulnerabilities, and the patch is available from microsoft here: Microsoft Security Bulletin <span class="caps">MS05</span>-039</p>


	<p>More updates coming as we analyze and gather more information!</blockquote></p>


	<p>From the <a href="http://isc.sans.org/index.php?on=port"><span class="caps">SANS</span> Internet Storm Center</a></p>


	<p>Hope ya'll patched your Windows boxes. If not, get to work! I have already noticed some slowness on the internet - possibly because the cable modem segment that I am on is filled with unprotected Windows boxes.</p>


	<p>Let me check my home network...</p>


	<p>2 Macs - Check
1 Linux - Check</p>


	<p>All done!</p>


	<p>What is totally silly about this is that the worm exploits the windows Plug and Play system via port 445. A big <span class="caps">WTF</span> goes out to the guys in Redmond:  why does Plug and Play need to access <em>any</em> IP ports? Unless ya'll are using PnP to mount network drives - but come on. No one would be...</p>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Of course, I patched up my winXP machine, but not without a little hassle from Microsoft. Apparently, they're doing this authenticity check of windows software before you can do the regular round of critical updates.

At first, I had a problem in that my software wouldn't authenticate (even though it IS a legitimate copy).

Did I mention that I am so done with windows?

I'm almost wonder if Bill isn't in cahoots with all the antivirus companies.]]></wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Your password is like a Lover. Best when enjoyed alone, and not passed around.</p>


<blockquote>Let me just sum this up with a bit of security advice: Don't ever give your account info to anyone else <span class="caps">AND</span> don't ever let someone (not even Ma or Pa) use your computer logged in as you. Yes, there are times when you will want to for convenience sake, and I'm sure the usage will appear inert and innocent, but they always do. Guest accounts are there for a reason. Your account is meant for you and no one else. </blockquote>

	<p>-<a href="http://securityawareness.blogspot.com/2005/08/root-nasty-four-letter-word.html">Security Awareness for Ma, Pa and the Corporate Clueless</a></p>


	<p>I have run into many problems with accounts, passwords and failure to control them over the years.. a few of my favorites follow</p>


	<p>&lt;!<del>-more</del>-&gt;</p>


<li>First off - years ago a company lets their network admin go. They leave on less then pleasant terms. A week later, they realize that they do not have the supervisor password to there NetWare 3.x box.

	<p>They call the ex-admin. He says that he does not have the password anymore. They panic</p>


	<p>They call me - I charge them an hour's labor to drive out, and execute an <span class="caps">NLM</span> that changes the password for the supervisor user on a NetWare 3.x box.</li></p>


<li>Another one - An admin deletes the Admin account on a NetWare 4.x tree. The only admin account. They do not notice until they need to add another user. They cannot get into the tree to do anything.

	<p>They call me, I come out. They only tell me that they needed help adding a user. Several hours later (and a call to Novell Tech Support, a Fax to them with the signature of the owner of the company and a downloaded one shot <span class="caps">NLM</span>) we run an <span class="caps">NLM</span> and create a new admin user account.</li></p>


<li>A teacher leaves his computer logged in and unlocked during the lunch hour. Some kids use his computer to access less then appropriate material. The teacher is written up for accessing the material as it was his user name and computer that accessed it.</li>

<li>A user leaves his computer logged in. Another user uses his email account to send less then Politically Correct jokes to their supervisor. Guess who gets written up? The user that left his computer logged in.</li>

	<p>All of this should go to show that your account is extremely important. Do not give out your password to anyone.</p>


	<p>I used to run training for security awareness for several companies that I used to work for. I would ask the question - what if your helpdesk calls and needs your password for some work on your account?</p>


	<p>What if the president of the US needs your password?</p>


	<p>Just say no. Keep your passwords to yourself. Change your passwords often, and use things that are complex, and memorable.</p>


	<p>like the following</p>


	<p>Iluv2:)@thesun</p>


	<p>I love to smile at the sun</p>


	<p>Hard to guess, hard to hack, good password.</p>


	<p>Good luck out there - it's a dangerous world!</p>]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[People always laugh at me for the length of my passwords. They just don't get it. Sometimes for fun I will crack my friends passwords and then send them an e-mail with their new one. And, I'm not doing anything other than using educated guesses for the most part...no software, just some quick guesses.

In this age of blogging and &quot;self-revealing,&quot; you need to be sure that you're password isn't given away by your writing and interests.

And, don't use the same PW for multiple accounts!?]]></wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Herbert A. Millington
Chair - Search Committee
412A Clarkson Hall, Whitson University
College Hill, <span class="caps">MA  34109</span></p>


	<p>Dear Professor Millington,</p>


	<p>Thank you for your letter of March 16.  After careful consideration, I
regret to inform you that I am unable to accept your refusal to offer me
an assistant professor position in your department.</p>


	<p>This year I have been particularly fortunate in receiving an unusually
large number of rejection letters.  With such a varied and promising field
of candidates, it is impossible for me to accept all refusals.</p>


	<p>Despite Whitson's outstanding qualifications and previous experience in
rejecting applicants, I find that your rejection does not meet my needs at
this time.  Therefore, I will assume the position of assistant professor
in your department this August.  I look forward to seeing you then.</p>


	<p>Best of luck in rejecting future applicants.</p>


	<p>Sincerely,
Chris L. Jensen</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><li>An open source project is about people producing free and open software and contributing to something as a team for the benefit of others.</li>
<li> Open source projects reflect the spirit of collaboration and fun while garnering community feedback and providing good governance that allows for business to confidently invest in its development.</li>
<li>Open source projects are open to the participation of anybody who can contribute value and is willing to work with the community.</li>
</blockquote>

	<p>I think that this is one of the best definitions of Open Source that I have seen. So many of the Open Source projects forget these tenants. The leaders seem to be off on some adolescent power trip - and beware anyone who questions, asks or even makes a small noise in the corner.</p>


	<p>I guess the beauty of Open Source is that the projects that are run like this will die off, and the better managed ones will succeed.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>In the second half of 2006, Otellini said Intel will introduce the micro-architecture, which combines the strength of the company's current Intel NetBurst and Pentium M micro-architectures and adds new features.

	<p>The multicore foundation will help enable unique computer designs that will power the industry's most sophisticated and user-friendly digital home and office PCs, according to the company. It will also help IT managers increase responsiveness and productivity while at the same time reducing real-estate and electricity burdens company's face as server data centers grow.</blockquote></p>

	<p>Also check out the story (with Pictures!) at <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/tradeshows/showdoc.aspx?i=2503">AnandTech</a></p>


	<p>No unexpected news here. Sounds like Intel is jumping on to the <span class="caps">PPC</span> bandwagon - it's not raw clockspeed that matters, rather it's real preformance, power consumption and heat that really matters.</p>


	<p>I mean - who cares if you have a 6 gigahertz chip that melts down in 65 seconds? Really!</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>1 tbs. Oregano
1 tbs. Sage
4 tbs. dried Onion
1 tsp Cayenne Powder (more if you like it hotter)
2 - 4 tbs. Garlic (mushed fresh the best)
2 lb. ground beef
1 can tomato sauce
1 can Black Beans
1 can Pinto Beans
6 oz good beer
6 oz your favorite salsa (heat up to you)
Jalapeno Tabasco to taste
Salt to taste</p>


	<p>Heat some oil in a stew pan with the Sage, Garlic, Onion and Oregano. When it is hot, add beef. Mush it up good - we don't want any large parts left. After the beef is browned (but the grease is still there) add beer and salsa. simmer for a few moments. While that is simmering, take 1/4 of each of the cans of beans and smash them up good. Add all of the beans and the tomato sauce. Stir while it's simmering. Simmer for about 30 min to an hour. Season to taste.</p>


	<p>Optional - for the truly dukky taste - add 1/2 cup hot, black, strong coffee to the mix.</p>


	<p>Serve it with some fresh White Onions over it, and perhaps some good Extra Sharp Cheddar.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was just going to ignore this, but...</p>


<blockquote>As you probably know, Pat Roberston called for the assassination of Hugo Chavez, the semi-democratically elected leader of Venezuala, and he is getting pilloried by both the right and the left on this...

	<p>Many are calling his remarks 'un-Christian.' I don't know that that criticism is appropriate. Certainly it is not clear to me that assassination would be precluded by the Christian faith.</blockquote></p>


	<p>-<a href="http://davejustus.blogspot.com/2005/08/robertson-and-chavez-assassination.html">Justus</a></p>


	<p>This was my response:</p>


	<p>That is a really scary comment. What is more scary, is that it can be true - depending on your interpretation of the Bible. If you follow J.C.'s version of Christianity - then no. Killing is simply not condoned at all.</p>


	<p>If you read the Old Testament - then heck yeah - kill all of the folks that you do not like, that live in your land, that look askance at your goats. This is what Abortion bombers and radical Irish Christians use to justify their deadly practices.</p>


	<p>I applaud the Christians that have actually come out and said that Robertsons comment was way out of line. To have a Religious leader from the US talking about an act of Terror like assassinating someone? That is what we are supposedly fighting against.</p>


	<p>Now, I do not advocate any legal action against Mr Robertson. He is well within his 1st Amendment rights to say such a thing. However, I feel that it is on our shoulders as fellow Americans to show the world that we do not agree with an extremist view such as that.</p>


	<p>If the people of Venezuela disagree with what their leader is espousing, then it is their job to make this thing right. America does not have the resources, nor the right to topple every government that we disagree with, and replace it with one of our liking.</p>


	<p>I do feel that democracy is probably one of the better forms of government that is out there, however it is not our place to force the rest of the world to follow our lead. When they are ready, They will do it. We have seen it in the former <span class="caps">USSR</span> and other places. People are generally smart creatures. They can usually see what is up, and make choices to take action.</p>


	<p>Dave went further in a comment:</p>


<blockquote>Particularly that no dictorship has a right to exist, and any free nation wishing to topple a dictorship has the moral right to do so. Protecting another people from aggression, even agression from their own government, is allowable under just war theory.</blockquote>

	<p>I follow the 'Do not start it, but finish it' theory. There is no such thing as a '<em>just</em>' aggressive act. The only time that violence can be justified in any way is in self defense. That includes Governments - the only time that we can justify war is when we are attacked.</p>


	<p>The 'war on terror' is justifiable. <span class="caps">WW II</span> was justified. Iraq was not. Toppling Governments because we disagree with them is certainly not justifiable.</p>


	<p>However, since we are in Iraq, we need to make sure that the job is 100 percent done before we leave. If we just leave now, the Iraqi people will be left in quite a lurch.  No stable government, no stable anything. Many would die, and more then likely, the country would be worse off then when we started over there.</p>


	<p>That is unacceptable. We created this mess - we need to fix it. I fully support the troops, and Bush in saying that we have to stay the course.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<blockquote>Speaking on the television program he hosts, 'The 700 Club,â€ Mr. Robertson lashed out at the Venezuelan strongman once more, telling his audience, 'It's high time that the United States coveted Hugo Chavez' wife.â€

	<p>Warming to his topic, the opinionated preacher added, 'And while we're at it, we should covet his house, his manservant, his maidservant..and his ass, for that matter.</blockquote></p>
