<blockquote><span class="caps">SCIENTISTS</span> have created "miracle mice" that can regenerate amputated limbs or damaged vital organs, making them able to recover from injuries that would kill or permanently disable normal animals.

<p>The experimental animals are unique among mammals in their ability to regrow their heart, toes, joints and tail.</blockquote></p>

<p>We all know that 'mice today, people tomorrow'. Imagine the possibilities. Broken wrist that will never heal correctly? Chop it off, and let it regrow new.</p>


<p>It reminds me of a quote from Firefly.</p>

<p>We are truly living in a spaceship, dear.</p>
