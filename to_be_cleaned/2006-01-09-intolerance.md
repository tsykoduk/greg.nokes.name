<blockquote>The Buddha said: "If outsiders speak against me, the Teaching, or the Order,  you should not be angry, for that would prevent your own self-conquest. Similarly, if they praise us. But you should find out what is false or true, and acknowledge  the fact. And even in praise it is only of trifling matters that an unconverted  man might speak of me."</blockquote>

<p>I am really intolerant of intolerant people!</p>

Thus goes the circle of hate and bigotry. I have read several comments to articles in the last weeks that have really hit this point home:
<blockquote>I'm all for humor and poking fun. However these folks find the show offensive. If it was Buddha or Mohamad showing up would it be any less offensive?</blockquote>

<p>However, a rigid worldview based on the teachings of a book - any book - might not be the best way to approach things. We have an amazing intellect at our beck and call, and yet so many people shelve it to allow others to do their thinking for them. They let their governments choose what is good and bad for them, and they sit in churches letting a pastor, priest or imam tell them what to think about social and philosophical topics.</p>


<p>It's this kind of reliance on others thinking for your basic belief structure that breeds <a href="http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=0006A854-E67F-13A1-A67F83414B7F0104">murdercide</a> and the <a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/abo_viol.htm">bombing of abortion clinics</a>. If you really have the truth, why do you need to kill people that disagree? It's only through your own disbelief that such acts are fostered. And that really troubles me. It's like the world needs a wake up call. 9/11 seems to not have been it. What's next?</p>


I will leave with some thoughts from the Dalai Lama:

<blockquote>Buddha always emphasized the rational pursuit of truth. "He instructed his disciples to critically judge his words before accepting them. He always advocated reason over blind faith."

<p>"Buddha was speaking about reality," says the Dalai Lama. "Reality may be one, in its deepest essence, but Buddha also stated that all propositions about reality are only contingent. Reality is devoid of any  intrinsic identity that can be captured by any one single proposition ,  that is what Buddha meant by "voidness." Therefore, Buddhism strongly discourages blind faith and fanaticism."</p>


<p>"Of course, there are different truths on different levels. Things are true relative to other things; "long" and "short" relate to each other, "high" and "low," and so on. But is there any absolute truth? Something self-sufficient, independently true in itself? I don't think so."</p>


<p>"In Buddhism we have the concept of "interpretable truths," teachings that are reasonable and logical for certain people in certain situations. Buddha himself taught different teachings to different people under different circumstances. For some people, there are beliefs based on a Creator. For others, no Creator. The only "definitive truth" for Buddhism is the absolute negation of any one truth as the Definitive Truth."</blockquote>
