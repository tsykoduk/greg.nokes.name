<p>I have been using the term "Viking Coder" for a several years now. Honestly, it was a "equal and opposite" reaction to the rise of the Rockstar Ninja Samurai whatever in job descriptions. I don't play a guitar or dress in black PJ's. I am a tall dude, and I like simple solutions to problems. And I have a least a little bit of Scandinavian in me.</p>


<p>Some folks asked me what I meant by viking coders. So, with out further gnashing of teeth, here you go.</p>
