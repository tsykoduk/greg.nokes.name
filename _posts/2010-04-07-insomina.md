So, I've had this curse since I was a kid. I just cannot sleep sometimes. I'm still really tired and groggy, I just can't sleep. 

It's really times like this that get the mind running into some of it's darker corners. This is that mystical point, where good ideas flow, and right when I get a head of steam up on an idea, I fall asleep.
