As we make things more complex, do we make things better? Are we lowering the bar to entry or raising it? When I was a kid, the [BBS scene](http://textfiles.com/bbs/) was the way that most of us got into computers. That required a lot. I was very privileged to be able to have a [C64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64) and a 300 baud modem when I was a pre-teen.

[Matt Arnold's Treehouse
](https://piusbird.space/wordpress/2022/09/what-have-we-lost/) wrote up a great summary of the experience of getting into technology in the early 2000's. I'd posit that having a computer in 2004 was privileged. I helped kids get into computing in the late 90's and early 2000's, and a lot of the ones that I talked to only had computers at school much less internet access. 

Computing is far more widespread and accessable then it ever has been. Heck most phones now have many magnitudes more computing power then my old C64.

I feel like the disconnect is in the accessibility of learning tools, combined with the assumption that everyone needs to know system level languages and how TCP/IP works in order to be in tech. I disagree. Some of the best folks in tech that I have had the honor to work alongside have probably never used `ping` or `traceroute` in anger. And honestly, why should they? They are building on top of abstractions that the systems level folks have built.
