Footprints in the Sand
...the Discordian version

<!--more-->

I dreamed that I was walking down the beach with the Goddess. And

I looked back and saw footprints in the sand. But sometimes there

were two pairs of footprints and sometimes there was only one.

And the times there was only one set of footprints, those were my

times of greatest trouble. So I asked the Goddess,
"Why in my greatest need did you abandon me?"
She replied, "I never left you. Those were the times we both

hopped on one foot."
And I was really embarrassed for bothering Her with such a stupid

question.
