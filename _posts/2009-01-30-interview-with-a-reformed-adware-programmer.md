<blockquote>I should probably first speak about how adware works. Most adware targets Internet Explorer (IE) users because obviously they're the biggest share of the market. In addition, they tend to be the less-savvy chunk of the market. If you're using IE, then either you don't care or you don't know about all the vulnerabilities that IE has.</blockquote>

Good read. My most juicy bit:</p>

<p>M: Um, run <span class="caps">UNIX</span>.</p>


<p>S: [ laughs]</p>


<p>M: We did actually get the ad client working under Wine on Linux.</p>


<p>S: That seems like a bit of a stretch!</p>


<p>M: That was a pretty limited market, Iâ€™d say</p>
