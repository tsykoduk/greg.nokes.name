I decided to dust off `ab` and see what the performance of the new blog is.

It's running on a single Heroku Hobby Dyno, with 512m of RAM. It's running nginx/1.9.7, Puma 3.11.2 and Ruby 2.3.4-p301. All of the files are static, generated by Jekyll.

I ran AB with a concurrency of 20 on it, and it handled it very well. There was no appreciable CPU load generated during the test. Average RAM jumped by about 100m during the test, and started to back off afterwards.

```

I then  decided to turn it up to 11, and ran with a concurrency of 100. The max CPU load jumped up above five, and the RAM jumped by about 200m. Still not a bad showing. 18 rps is not bad for a single, small container.
