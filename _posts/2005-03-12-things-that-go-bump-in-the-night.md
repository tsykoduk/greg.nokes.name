So, reading more and thinking more. That is always a dangerous combination. Here is what I am thinking about right now.

Given that the universe is at least as [holistic](http://www.encyclopedia.com/html/M/Machspri.asp) [as](http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/physics/pdf/0112/0112094.pdf) [modern](http://citebase.eprints.org/cgi-bin/citations?id=oai:arXiv.org:gr-qc/9812003) physics thinks it is, perhaps even more, what can we gain by exploring smaller and smaller parts of it to more and more resolution?

I guess that the quandary is as follows. Every part of the universe, from the smallest particle, can effect every other part of the universe. We are, in fact, all in this together. By segmenting our knowledge into smaller and smaller disciplines, are we in fact doing our greater good a disservice?

To understand a system, be it a computer system, an engine, or a biosphere - one needs a high level understanding of how all of the pieces and parts interact.

For example - you would never take you car to a person who only knew how spark plugs worked (but knew every last little detail about spark plugs) to get it fixed would you? You would want some one who had a general understanding of the entire thing worked.

You would want that person working on designing new spark plugs!

Same goes with science. We have people who are so tightly focused on their specialties that they cannot see the whole picture. We have people who only think about string theory and how it works, but know little about the structure of distant stars. I would think that generalists who have a good understanding of many fields of study (but not in depth) might be needed. If for nothing more then to keep abreast of all of the developments in all of the fields and try and see where one field might benefit from others.

I guess what I am saying it that generalists and specialists are needed. And that there not be a stigma associated with being a generalist.
