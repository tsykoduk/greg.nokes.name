<blockquote>
  Can you prove you love your city?

<p>I tend to break the universe down into three parts:</p>

<p><strong>The Subjective Universe</strong></p>

<p>This is the realm of our feelings and beliefs. Love and Faith and Hate and God live here. It's all internal to our minds and psyche. There is no truth or proof here - only opinion and faith.</p>

<p><strong>The Objective Universe</strong></p>

<p>This is what we perceive. It's still not fact - but it's as close as we can get to truth by ourselves. Our perceptions are all edited for content by our subconscious as they are traveling the neural pathways into our minds. We basically have a few passive sensor systems - our eyes, ears, touch and smell (taste is part of smell). We have parts of our brains that are dedicated signal processors. They take as input the raw data from these sensory systems and output processed data that we can understand.</p>

<p>There is a time lag between the perceptions and the post-processing data. So, the external world is not really perceived as it happens. The processing takes place in the subjective universe. Everything is spun according to the whims of your subconscious. This leads to...</p>

<p><strong>The Real Universe</strong></p>

<p>This is what is really real. We cannot directly perceive this. It's like the story of the four blind men and the elephant. We each base what we believe reality to be on our perceptions. It's only when we actually sit down and discuss what each of us perceive that we can come close to approximating what reality really is.</p>

<hr />

<p>I see the universe as a matrix made up first of the bubbles of each persons subjective universe which are contained in overlapping fields of people's objective universes all contained in the greater real universe.</p>

<p>So - to answer the question: No. I cannot prove it except through my actions. Love, Hate, Good, Evil - these are all parts of each of our subjective universes.</p>
