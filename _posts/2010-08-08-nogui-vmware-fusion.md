<p>One of the things that I like to do it launch my VM's with out a GUI - it takes a little less resources, and it does not clutter up my Mac's desktop with windows that I do not need. It's been hard to do in the past.</p>

<p>Enter <a href="http://github.com/tsykoduk/VMWare-Fusion-Launcher">VMWare Fusion Launcher</a>. Currently it's tested under Ruby 1.9.2dev, so YMMV.</p>
