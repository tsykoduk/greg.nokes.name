description: "Learn how to create a flexible name display system in Ruby on Rails that formats person names in multiple ways using polymorphic associations and attribute models."
---
<p>In an application I am writing, we gather three items about a person's Name: Their Username and  their First and last names.</p>


<p>In different parts of the application we want to have their names displayed in different ways. For Example, we want to have the opening page say Hi, First Name!. We want log entries to display their Username in one field, and their Last Name comma First Name in another field. We want to have their First Initial comma Last Name in another area.</p>


<p>In this application, we store names as attributes in an attributes table, rather then in the person table. I talked about <a href="https://greg.nokes.name/2007/1/3/cross-model-attributes">Cross Model Attributes</a> a while ago.</p>


<p>We assume the following:</p>


<ul>
<li>Person is the model for people</li>
<li>Person.name is the username</li>
<li>Attrib is the model for attributes</li>
<li>Attrib.name holds the name of the Attribute</li>
<li>Attrib.value holds the value</li>
<li>We have polymorphic associations set up</li>
</ul>

<p>To accommodate all of these different display needs, I wrote this little snippet of code:</p>

```ruby
def namer(person_id, format) 
  #Namer will return the person_id's name in the desired format 
  #0 is First name only 
  #1 is Last name only 
  #2 is Last Name, First Name 
  #3 is First name Last name 
  #4 First Inital, Last Name 
  #5 First name, last inital
  
  person = Person.find_by_id(person_id) 
  
  unless person.attrib.find_by_name('First Name').nil? 
    f = person.attrib.find_by_name('First Name') 
    first = f[:value].to_s 
  else 
    tmp = 'No Name' 
    return person.name 
  end 
  
  unless person.attrib.find_by_name('Last Name').nil? 
    l = person.attrib.find_by_name('Last Name') 
    last = l[:value].to_s 
  else 
    tmp = 'No Name' 
    return person.name 
  end 
  
  case format
   when 0 return first 
   when 1 return last 
   when 2 tmp = last + ', ' + first 
     return tmp 
   when 3 tmp = first + ' ' + last 
     return tmp 
   when 4 tmp = first[0..0].upcase + ' ' + last 
      return tmp 
   when 5 tmp = first + ' ' + last[0..0].upcase 
     return tmp 
  end 
end
```
