I've been practicing Buddhism for about twenty years. I've also been teaching and leading teams for most of that time. First as a sysadmin wrangling NetWare 3 implementations, then through various roles at Engine Yard, Heroku, and now Snowflake. Somewhere along the way, the two practices started informing each other.

This isn't a framework or a methodology. It's more field notes from someone who's been trying to find their way through corporate America, startups and everything in between with the tools they have at hand.

## Walking in their shoes

Early in my career, I was a fixer. Someone brought me a problem, I solved it. Fast. That's what good engineers do, right? I had an ability to visualize systems, and locate the root of problems. It turned out, I was good at holding context in my mind and then preforming (binary searches)[https://greg.nokes.name/2010/04/16/binary-searching/#article].

When I was that young sysadmin working on NetWare implementations, I would get frustrated when users didn't understand the systems we were offering them. Why couldn't they just *get it*? Over time, I realized my frustration was rooted in a lack of empathy. These users weren't technology people; they had their own specializations and skills. Rather than focusing on what they didn't understand, I needed to see the world from where they stood.

The moment I let myself walk in their shoes, everything changed. I started approaching problem-solving differently—centered on their needs, their understanding, their comfort with technology. The results were immediate. Problems got solved faster because I was solving the *right* problems.

Growing up in tech, we're taught to focus on technical skills and data-driven decisions. We need to understand complex systems, optimize processes. All true. But I've found that the ability to connect with people on a human level is just as critical. You can architect a perfect system, but if you can't understand why someone is struggling to use it, you've only done half the job.

## Listening before fixing

Buddhism talks about "right speech," but the harder practice is right listening. Full attention. Not planning your response while the other person is still talking.

I have a quirk: when I'm intently listening to something, I tend to lean back. It can look like I'm disengaged, but I'm not—I'm processing. I've had to learn in 1:1s to adjust that a bit, to present as more engaged than my natural posture suggests. Everyone has their own dialect of body language, and part of the work is learning to read each person individually.

One thing I've gotten better at over the years: pausing before responding. It used to feel awkward, like dead air. Now I know that silence can be powerful. It gives you time to actually think about what was said, not just react. Pauses can actually make you sound smarter, because you *are* thinking instead of just talking.

I also started using "So what I heard is..." to make sure I understood before jumping to solutions. Simple technique, but it catches misunderstandings before they compound.

## Staying steady when things break

Production incidents have a certain clarity. Something is on fire, you fix it. But organizational uncertainty—layoffs, reorgs, strategy pivots—that's harder. The ground shifts and keeps shifting.

Buddhism calls this equanimity: the ability to maintain a steady mind amidst gain or loss, victory or defeat. It's one of the Four Immeasurables, alongside love, compassion, and something called empathetic joy (more on that in a moment).

Equanimity isn't about not caring. It's about not letting anxiety make your decisions for you. I've watched leaders make impulsive calls during uncertain times—over-communicate, under-communicate, reorganize teams that didn't need reorganizing—because sitting with "I don't know yet" felt unbearable.

The practice is noticing the discomfort without immediately acting on it. Sometimes the best move is to wait, gather information, and let your team see that uncertainty doesn't mean panic. Leadership is rarely a calm sea. More like navigating a storm. The skill is holding your course steady regardless of the external chaos.

## Seeing the system, not just the person

When someone on my team is struggling, my first instinct used to be: what's wrong with them? Now I ask: what's wrong with the system around them?

Nine times out of ten, performance problems are environment problems. Unclear expectations, misaligned incentives, missing context, bad tooling. The person is responding rationally to a broken situation.

This is Buddhism meeting systems thinking. Interdependence isn't just a spiritual concept—it's how organizations actually work. Change the conditions, change the behavior. The person is part of a system, and if you only look at the person, you'll miss the actual problem.

## Sharing in their wins

There's a Buddhist concept called *mudita*—sometimes translated as "sympathetic joy" or "empathetic joy." It's the practice of finding genuine happiness in other people's happiness.

This sounds simple, but it's surprisingly hard. It means stepping aside and letting others take the spotlight. It means putting collective triumph above personal recognition. It means defining your success by how well you've helped others succeed.

When people around you win, you win. Not as a platitude, but as an actual practice. You look for opportunities to feel that shared glow.

I notice it in small moments now. Next time you catch me smiling at a toddler who has a huge grin and is just charging off somewhere—that's mudita. I'm sharing in their joy.

## The long game

I got some advice once about track driving: "Pick one turn and work on it. When you've improved, pick another. Eventually you'll have improved your whole lap time. Then start again."

Leadership development works the same way. You don't become a better leader by reading a book about leadership. You become a better leader by noticing one thing you do poorly, working on it until it's slightly less poor, and then picking the next thing.

Twenty years in, I'm still working on turns. The listening. The patience. The not-reacting. Some days I nail it, some days I don't. That's the practice.

It's a lifetime journey, not a checkbox to tick.

None of this is secret knowledge. Most experienced leaders figure out some version of it, Buddhist or not. But having a framework—a practice—helps me remember it when things get hard. Which is when it matters most.
