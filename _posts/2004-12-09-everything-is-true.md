description: "Explore how Buddhism, Zen, and Discordism intersect through existentialist philosophy. Discover the paradox that "everything is true" and the beauty of meaningless chaos."

>"I am not a logician. I am an existentialist. I believe in this meaningless, beautiful
chaos of existence, and I am ready to go with it wherever it leads. I don't have a goal, 
because existence has no goal. It simply is, flowering, blossoming, dancing - but don't ask why. Just an overflow of energy, for no reason at all. I am with existence."  Osho

I also identify with Discordism, and this passage neatly intertwines Buddhism, Zen and Discord. No Mind - existing at the whim of the present merges neatly with Discordism

>GP: Is Eris true?
>M2: Everything is true.
>GP: Even false things?
>M2: Even false things are true.
>GP: How can that be?
>M2: I don't know man, I didn't do it!
