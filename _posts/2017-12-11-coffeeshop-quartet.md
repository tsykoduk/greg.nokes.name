As a remote worker, and one that travels at that, finding a good coffee shop to work from is a hassle. Sometimes I want a loud place with a lot of bustle, sometimes I want someplace more like a library. I'm often on calls, so when I have a day with out calls, and I can get out and about I really enjoy it.

I once had a freind point me to a job where the only day to day interaction was via Slack and Email. That sounds like nirvana to me! Voice communication is important, however having the time to craft a reply and being able to work from any coffee shop every day seems to be a great perk.

I love what I do, but I'd say if I could change one thing, it would be a lot less phone calls...
