<blockquote>11 years ago, April 1st 1990, RFC 1149 was written. This RFC specifies a protocol for IP over avian carriers, <span class="caps">CPIP</span> (carrier pigeon internet protocol). In 11 years, no one has bothered to implement this important protocol stack. But happily, we don't need to wait any longer! <span class="caps">BLUG</span> in cooperation with Vesta Brevdueforening has given you RFC 1149 support for Linux.</blockquote>

<p>For you backwoods types, now you can do IP over Carrier Pigeon.</p>
