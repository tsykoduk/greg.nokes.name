Every time someone asks me about my desk, I feel like I end up needing to bring this article up to date.

<!-- more -->

I currently use the following gear for my standing desk:

* **[M2 Pro Mac Mini](https://www.apple.com/mac/)** I bought my second Mac Mini when the M2 Pro chip came out - and I have to say it's one of the better computers I've owned. Silent, fast, stable - it handles the work that I throw at it. I am eyeing upgrading to on of the M4 iMac's, as I miss a second screen.
* **[Apple Studio Display](https://www.apple.com/studio-display/)** : I ditched my Calidigit, Camera and huge monitor for this - and I have to say it's great. I used a old Apple Studio display for going on a decade, and I expect to get almost as much life out of this one.
* **[Elgato Key Light](: https://www.elgato.com/en/key-light)**: I still have this, and with the addition of adding it to a Home Assistant cluster so I can have it in my "start working" and "stop working" scenes in my HomeKit house, it's a beast, Yeah, two (one on each side) would be better, but I have a window in front of me, and Seattle willing sometimes I get natural light.
* **[Blue Yeti Mic](https://www.bluemic.com/en-us/products/yeti)**: Good solid microphone. I replaced my old grey one with a newer black one, as the them on my desk is wood, silver and black.
* **[Rode PSA1 Boom](https://www.rode.com/accessories/stands/psa1)**: I played around with a few, and landed on this one. It's worked well for a long time now. Highly recommended.
* **[Radius III](https://www.bluemic.com/en-us/accessories/)**: A damping mount is important if you don't want to sound like a drummer when you type. 
* **Sony MDR7506** Wired Headphones. I have a extension cable running from my mic around to the underside of my desk, and then the headphones plug into that, to keep my desk fairly cable free. These are tanks, and work perfectly after years of use.
* **VocalBeat Foam Windscreen for Blue Yeti** - the best $15 I have ever spent on my desk AV set up.
