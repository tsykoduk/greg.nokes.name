Every time someone asks me about my desk, I find myself updating this article. Having [worked remotely](https://greg.nokes.name/2020/03/03/working-remote/) for many years, I've built up a library of best practices and tools that work for me. I share these insights in the hope that others can learn from my experiences, improve their workflow, and look and sound better on camera!

Transitioning to remote work wasn't just about shifting locations; it was about reimagining how I approach my daily tasks. Over the years, I've realized that a well thought out workspace isn't a luxury, it's a necessity. My desk has become more than just a place to set my laptop; it's become a productivity hub tailored to my needs.

I currently use the following gear:

**[M2 Pro Mac Mini](https://www.apple.com/mac/)** 

I upgraded to the M2 Pro Mac Mini when it was released, making it my second Mac Mini experience. My first was a first generation Mac Mini, and I still have it on a shelf! This machine is a powerhouse. Silent, fast, and incredibly stable.

Why I Love It:

* Compact Design: Its small footprint saves valuable desk space.
* Performance: The M2 Pro chip ensures smooth multitasking and rapid processing.
* Longevity: Apple's robust ecosystem means this Mac Mini will stay relevant for years.

I'm considering upgrading to one of the upcoming M4 iMacs, mainly because I miss having a second screen. The idea of an all-in-one solution with Apple's sleek design is quite appealing.

**[Apple Studio Display](https://www.apple.com/studio-display/)** 

Switching to the Apple Studio Display was a game-changer. I replaced my CalDigit dock, external camera, and bulky monitor with this elegant piece of technology.

Standout Features:

* 5K Retina Display: Crystal-clear visuals with exceptional color accuracy—perfect for design work and media consumption.
* Integrated Camera and Speakers: The built-in 12MP Ultra Wide camera with Center Stage keeps me framed during video calls, and the high-fidelity speakers provide immersive audio.
* Seamless Integration: It connects effortlessly with my Mac Mini, reducing cable clutter.

Having used an older Apple Studio Display for nearly a decade, I have confidence in the durability and longevity of this new model.

**[Elgato Key Light](: https://www.elgato.com/en/key-light)**

Lighting is crucial, especially when you're on camera frequently. The Elgato Key Light provides professional-grade illumination, ensuring I look my best during video conferences and webinars.

Why I keep it:

* Adjustable Brightness and Color Temperature: Tailor the lighting to suit any time of day or weather condition.
* Desk-Mounted: Saves space and reduces the need for floor-standing lamps.
* Smart Home Integration: I've connected it to my Home Assistant setup, allowing me to include it in my "start working" and "stop working" scenes within my HomeKit environment.

While having two Key Lights would offer even lighting, my desk faces a window, and on sunny Seattle days, natural light fills the room, complementing the Key Light perfectly.

**[Blue Yeti Mic](https://www.bluemic.com/en-us/products/yeti)**

Clear audio enhances communication, making meetings more effective and recordings more professional. The Blue Yeti microphone has been my trusted companion in this regard for years now.

**[Rode PSA1 Boom](https://www.rode.com/accessories/stands/psa1)** 

After experimenting with various boom arms, the Rode PSA1 stood out for its reliability and ease of use.

* Smooth Movement: Easily adjust the microphone's position without noise.
* Full Rotation: Offers 360-degree rotation and extended reach.
* Sturdy Build: Holds the microphone securely in place.

This boom arm keeps my microphone at the perfect height and distance, ensuring optimal sound quality without cluttering my desk.


**[Radius III](https://www.bluemic.com/en-us/accessories/)**

Typing or moving items on the desk can introduce unwanted noise into recordings or calls. The Radius III shock mount isolates the microphone from vibrations. Having some sort of damping mount ensures that your audio remains clean, even during intense typing sessions.

**Sony MDR7506** 

These headphones are industry staples for a reason—they're durable, reliable, and deliver excellent sound quality. I've routed an extension cable from my microphone around to the underside of my desk, allowing me to plug in the headphones without visible wires, maintaining a clean workspace.

**VocalBeat Foam Windscreen for Blue Yeti** - the best $15 I have ever spent on my desk AV set up. It significantly improves sound quality by reducing plosives and ambient noise.
