Every time someone asks me about my desk, I find myself updating this article. Having [worked remotely](https://greg.nokes.name/2020/03/03/working-remote/) for many years, I've built up a library of best practices and tools that work for me. I share these insights in the hope that others can learn from my experiences, improve their workflow, and look and sound better on camera!

I currently use the following gear for my standing desk:

* **[M2 Pro Mac Mini](https://www.apple.com/mac/)** I purchased my second Mac Mini when the M2 Pro chip was released, and I have to say it's one of the best computers I've owned. Silent, fast, and stable - it handles everything I throw at it with ease. I am considering upgrading to one of the M4 iMacs, as I miss having a second screen.
* **[Apple Studio Display](https://www.apple.com/studio-display/)** : I replaced my CalDigit dock, camera, and large monitor with the Apple Studio Display, and it's been a fantastic change. I used an old Apple Studio Display for nearly a decade, and I expect to get just as much life out of this one. The reduction in desk clutter is appreciated.
* **[Elgato Key Light](: https://www.elgato.com/en/key-light)**: I still use the Elgato Key Light, and with the addition of integrating it into a Home Assistant cluster, I can include it in my "start working" and "stop working" scenes in my HomeKit-enabled home. It's a beast! While having two (one on each side) would be better, I have a window in front of me, and, Seattle weather permitting, I sometimes get natural light.
* **[Blue Yeti Mic](https://www.bluemic.com/en-us/products/yeti)**: Good solid microphone. I replaced my old grey one with a newer black one, as the them on my desk is wood, silver and black.
* **[Rode PSA1 Boom](https://www.rode.com/accessories/stands/psa1)**: I played around with a few, and landed on this one. It's worked well for a long time now. Highly recommended.
* **[Radius III](https://www.bluemic.com/en-us/accessories/)**: A damping mount is important if you don't want to sound like a drummer when you type. The Radius III does an excellent job of isolating the microphone from desk vibrations.
* **Sony MDR7506** Wired Headphones. I have a extension cable running from my mic around to the underside of my desk, and then the headphones plug into that, to keep my desk fairly cable free. These are tanks, and work perfectly after years of use.
* **VocalBeat Foam Windscreen for Blue Yeti** - the best $15 I have ever spent on my desk AV set up. It significantly improves sound quality by reducing plosives and ambient noise.
