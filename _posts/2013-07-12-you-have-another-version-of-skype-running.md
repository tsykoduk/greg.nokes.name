description: "Fix Skype \"Another Version Running\" error with this simple cleanup script. Stop Googling the solution every time Skype crashes or locks up."

I really hate this error. Skype is so unstable for me that I get little slowdowns and lock ups weekly, And about once a month I get this error after I've force killed it. I used to have to google it every time, drop to a command line and do a bunch of stuff. Well no more. Now there is a script to clean up after Skype's mess! Skype - you can barrow this if you want. Just have it run when Skype is launching.
