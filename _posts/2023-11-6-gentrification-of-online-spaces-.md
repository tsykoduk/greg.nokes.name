As someone who has been around online communities far longer then I'd like to admit, I have lived through many waves of community building, discovery and colonization. While I do not feel that an online community being gentrified is the same as a physical community suffering this fate, I do feel that there are lessions and observations that we can take from both sides of the experience.

Since my experience is primarily as a member of online communities I am going to stick to my lived experiences. 

I feel that we are seeing this same thing happening yet again on Mastodon today.

Some internet communities are built or started out of marginalized or counter-culture folks finding new ways to connect. Think the dial up BBS's, IRC or early forums. That was really it in the early days.

The early days of FIDOnet, WWIV and the Cyperpunks mailing lists where where my online persona was born. All you had to have was a modem and some sort of personal computer. The internet (and the smaller networks of FidoNet and WWIV and other BBS's) was a magical place for geeky little me. I could find people who had similar interests, and easily interact with them. Things like video games, Role Playing Games, Physics, and of course computers. In the 80's and early 90's finding folks who were into D&D was hard! It was not nearly as popular as it is these days.

We really embraced the counter-culture mantle. I don't think I actually watched any broadcast TV for years long swaths of the 90's.

We were proudly punks, and walked away from as much of the trappings of commercialism and polity society as we could. Our mantra was rebuilding the world.

Some corporate intrests saw value in these communities

Divesting control for better technology

Yahoo, Twitter, Tumblr, Facebook

Folks finding the "real internet" again
