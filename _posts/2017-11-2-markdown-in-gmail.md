I really like [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) for writing technical stuff. It makes it super easy to create code blocks, `embed commands in a sentence` and generally be really cool.

Back in the day, I used Chrome as my primary email interface into Gmail for work - because it had a cool extension called [Markdown Here](http://markdown-here.com). Well, I fell out of love with Chrome for various reasons and have switched to Safari, and along the way moved to Mail.app. I have since been forced to move back to a web interface for my email (`shakes fist at sky`). I thought that my days with markdown in the email interface were over.

Well, I used local search to see if I had a markdown editor installed locally so I could work on a technical email and then preview it, and past in into gmail. That local search popped up the old email thread where we were talking about [Markdown Here](http://markdown-here.com) years ago (see, a good reason for local email storage!) and I headed over to their webpage.

Well, guess what. They support Chrome, Firefox and Safari now! 

Happy days...
