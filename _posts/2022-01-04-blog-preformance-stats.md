A few years ago, I did some [performance]({% post_url 2018-2-2-blog-preformance-stats %}) testing on my blog. I run this blog on a single hobby dyno on the [Heroku Platform](https://www.heroku.com), and I have seen some performance changes over the past few months. Folks have even been tweeting about performance increases on Heroku, so I wanted to look at my non-scientific tests again.

It's running on a single Heroku Hobby Dyno, with 512m of RAM. It's running nginx, and  all of the files are static - generated by Jekyll.

**Testing**

I ran AB with a concurrency of 20 on it, and it handled it very well. 

```

  50%    567
  66%    578
  75%    814
  80%    823

  95%    845
  98%    862
  99%    936
 100%   9456 (longest request)
```

I then  decided to turn it up to 11, and ran with a concurrency of 100. Not a bad showing, 132 rps is really good for a single, small container.

So, it appears that I am seeing a big improvement in performance, with no real changes on my side. 

I'll attribute it to [Faster Dynos for All](https://blog.heroku.com/faster-dynos-for-all).
