Admittedly, I am a nerd. If you have not been watching Star Trek Strange New Worlds, I'd advise you drop everything and binge it right now. In my opinion, it's some of the best Star Trek ever.

One of the standout characters is Captain Pike. Watching him evolve as a leader over Star Trek Discovery season 2, and the two seasons of Strange New Worlds has been fascinating to me. In my mind, he embodies the leadership principles that I value, and that I've talked about in this blog over the last few months. Go watch it!
