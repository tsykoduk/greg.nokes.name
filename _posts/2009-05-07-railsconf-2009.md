<p>Well, it's <del>almost</del> over for me, but here are my thoughts about Railsconf 2009...</p>

            <!--more-->

            <p><img src="http://greg.nokes.name/assets/2009/5/7/IMG_0225_2.JPG" style="height: 95px; float: left; padding: 5px;" />I think that this picture (possible <span class="caps">NSFW</span>?) <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/glagla/54320217/">sums it up</a>. We are grownups. the <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=kerfluffle">kerfluffle</a> is over from when Ubuntu "crossed the line" and it will pass for Rails/Ruby as well.</p>


<p><a href="http://www.engineyard.com/blog/2009/engine-yard-flex-announced-new-features-added-to-solo/">Flex</a> is awesome. The coolest feature - to upgrade an instance to the newest stack, destroy it and recreate it. Heck, create a new one, spin it up, and then destroy the old instance.</p>


<p>Scaling is pretty simple. Start with solo, grow the instance as large as you need to, and then after you out grown a single instance environment, simply drop and re-add a flex instance. Database gets moved to it's own instance, and presto - you have a horizontally scaleable  cluster in the cloud. Pretty powerful.</p>


<p>Met some neat people, and I am going to dig into a few new products and see if I need to add them to my tool belt. More on that later.</p>


<p>I get the feeling that Rails (and ruby) is starting to penetrate the enterprise market space more and more, and I think that's a good thing. It's a powerful tool, and with nginx/passenger or apache/passenger it's pretty easy to run internally if you need to. If you can run it outside, <a href="http://www.engineyard.com/plans/solo/">Solo</a> for low to medium traffic applications is dead simple.</p>


<p>And, no this is not an advertisement for my <a href="http://www.engineyard.com">employer</a>. I honestly think that Solo/Flex is the easiest deployment option out there. I deployed Rubyflow about 4 or 5 times in 2 hours. I snagged a $30 coupon for <a href="http://heroku.com/">Heroku</a> so I will be giving them a shot in the next week or so, so expect a side by side shootout.</p>
