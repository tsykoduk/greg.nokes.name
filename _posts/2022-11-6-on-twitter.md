I am sure that you have [heard](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/misinformation/twitter-fires-employees-fight-misinformation-midterm-elections-rcna55750) the [news](https://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2022/11/04/elon-musk-twitter-layoffs-baron-interview-contd-orig-gr.cnn-business) about [twitter](https://www.ign.com/articles/social-media-alternatives-to-twitter-bluesky-reddit-cohost-mastodon). Any long time readers will know that I have been a long time user of that particular site.

I had spent a lot of time building a heavily curated experience there - with carefully selected follows to build a news stream that appeared to reflect reality.

Then the Musk showed up.

Transparently I used to be a fan of Elon's. He did a great job of appearing to be "just an engineer". However over the years more and more about his personal views, business practices and just general all around personality have really come to light. I may have been a little slow, but I got there. 

Wednesday of last week, as Musk walked into [twitter with the sink](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/26/elon-musk-carried-a-sink-into-twitter-on-wednesday-as-deal-nears-close.html), I did let that sink in. I really reflected on what that site brought to me. I decided it was not worth the risk to keep it as a primary interaction medium.

I've come a long way, and the tech landscape has come a long way in the last 15 years. I fondly recall when I added [tweetbot](https://tapbots.com/tweetbot/) to the launcher bar on my phone, and how twitter lived there for years.

As an aside, I have been a long, long time [tweetbot](https://tapbots.com/tweetbot/) user, and I still highly recommend it's use over the official twitter client.

Yesterday, I deleted [tweetbot](https://tapbots.com/tweetbot/) from my phone, and started to play around in the [Mastodon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastodon_(software)) space. 

I initially grabbed an account on [mastodon.online](https://mastodon.online). After doing some reading I decided that I wanted more control, and found that the big instances may not be the best experince. Big thanks to [FediTips](https://fedi.tips) for providing a great community service and the FAQ's!

Well, after my reading, I was convinced that I should just set up my own instance so I have more control. Currently, I am running my instance on [masto.host](https://masto.host). However since I own my own domains, I'm leveraging the neat URL of [social.nokes.name](https://social.nokes.name), and have the ability to move to self hosting if I decide to. I can also offer hosting to folks in the family who want a [social.nokes.name](https://social.nokes.name) handle.

I'll be honest, I am kind of liking this a lot. It feels like a combination of the old days - like if you smashed the best parts of [PHPNuke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP-Nuke) and [FidoNet](https://www.fidonet.org) together.

So I guess the moral of the story is sometimes out of the bad things, you can find some good.
