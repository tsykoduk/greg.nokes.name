I am sure that you have [heard](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/misinformation/twitter-fires-employees-fight-misinformation-midterm-elections-rcna55750) the [news](https://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2022/11/04/elon-musk-twitter-layoffs-baron-interview-contd-orig-gr.cnn-business) about [twitter](https://www.ign.com/articles/social-media-alternatives-to-twitter-bluesky-reddit-cohost-mastodon). Any long time readers will know that I have been a long time user of that particular site.

I had spent a lot of time building a heavily curated experience there - with carefully selected follows to build a news stream that appeared to reflect reality.

Then the Musk showed up.

Transparently I used to be a fan of Elon's. He did a great job of appearing to be "just an engineer". However over the years more and more about his personal views, business practices and just general all around personality have really come to light. I may have been a little slow, but I got there. 

Monday of this week, as Musk walked into [twitter with the sink](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/26/elon-musk-carried-a-sink-into-twitter-on-wednesday-as-deal-nears-close.html), I did let that sink in.

As an aside, I have been a long, long time [tweetbot](https://tapbots.com/tweetbot/) user, and I still highly recommend it's use over the official twitter client.

I initially grabbed an account on [mastodon.online](https://mastodon.online). After doing some reading. Big thanks to [FediTips](https://fedi.tips) for providing a great community service and the FAQ's!

Well, after my reading, I was convinced that I should just grab my own instance so I have more control. Currently, I am running my instance on [masto.host](https://masto.host). However since I own my own domains, I grabbed the neat [social.nokes.name](https://social.nokes.name), and have the ability to move to self hosting if I decide to.

I'll be honest, I am kind of liking this a lot. It feels like a combination of the old days - like if you smashed the best parts of [PHPNuke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP-Nuke) and [FidoNet](https://www.fidonet.org) together.
