I was sitting in a session about a consultive approach, and the presenter talked about the power of "and" rather then "or".
<!--more-->

This really got me thinking about how to apply this to the rest of life. It's like the "win/win" philosophy. If we can enter into a situation with the goal of making sure that everyone gets something positive, we can at least swing the percentage towards a positive outcome for ourselves.

It's when we are dealing with people that have a "me" or "all or nothing" outlook that we can run into problems. If we can approach from a perspective of "and" we can always bring value to the table. And small wins can lead to big wins.

It's my personal philosophy that by always bringing value and by (almost) never saying no you can succeed in just about anything.
