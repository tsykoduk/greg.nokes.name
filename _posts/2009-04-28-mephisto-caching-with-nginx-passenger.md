Now that I had this test bed for new hotness running the new hotness, I decided I should get the caching working again.

Well, this is 2.0 of the code. This seems to work a lot better (like, works in general).

```
server {

  listen  80;
  server_name  some_spiffy_name;
  root /wheremyappis/public;

  access_log /somelogfile.access.log main;
  error_log /someotherlog.error.log notice;
  client_max_body_size  50M;
  passenger_enabled on;

   location /assets/ {
        rewrite ^/assets/(.*)$ /assets/$http_host/$1 break;
   }

   location /cache/ {
        rewrite ^/cache/(.*)$ /cache/$http_host$1 break;
   }

}
```

And, as an added bonus, it's much easier to read!


Thanks to mibb in IRC , we were able to hack the following out:

```
 server {

  listen  80;
  server_name d;
  access_log ;
  error_log ;

  root ;
  passenger_enabled on;

location /assets/ {
  rewrite ^/assets/(.*)$ /assets/$http_host/$1 break;
}

# this appears to be broken
# / -&gt; index.html
#  if (-f $document_root/cache/$host$uri/index.html) {
#    rewrite (.*) /cache/$host$1/index.html break;
#  }

# /about -&gt; /about.html
  if (-f $document_root/cache/$host$uri.html) {
    rewrite (.*) /cache/$host$1.html break;
  }

# other files
  if (-f $document_root/cache/$host$uri) {
    rewrite (.*) /cache/$host$1 break;
  }

}
```
