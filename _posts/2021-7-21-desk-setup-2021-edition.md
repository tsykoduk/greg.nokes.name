I often get asked about my desk setup. I've put a lot of research and thought into my setup, but each desk is personal, and should be modified to fit your space. 

For example, I have a window in front of my desk, so I only run one light panel, because of the window. That being said, the gear that I have picked out is pretty solid, and has for the most part withstood the test of working at home 100% over the last year and a half, as well as being fully remote for well over 12 years.

I currently use the following gear for my standing desk:

* **[Razer Kyo Pro]( https://www.razer.com/streaming-cameras/razer-kiyo-pro/RZ19-03640100-R3U1 -)** camera - not the best in the world, but not super expensive and reasonable quality. Hit and miss with Mac - sometimes the camera needs a hard reboot to work. -- UPDATE: after upgrading to MacOS 12, the camera has seemed to stablize. Also, protip - do not install Razer's software.
* **[Rain Design M laptop stand](https://www.raindesigninc.com/mstand.html)** - I’ve had this stand for going on 15 years. It’s a tank.
* **Dell 4K UHD 2160p Monitor** (U3219Q):  Looks like it EOL’d but a solid USB-C driven monitor. My only complaint is that it does not have enough ports.
* **[Elgato Key Light](: https://www.elgato.com/en/key-light)**: Two (one on each side) would be better, but I have a window in front of me, and Seattle willing sometimes I get natural light.
* **[Blue Yeti Mic](https://www.bluemic.com/en-us/products/yeti)**: Good solid microphone.
* **[Rode PSA1 Boom](https://www.rode.com/accessories/stands/psa1)**: I played around with a few, and landed on this one. It's worked for going on 3 years.
* **Blue Yeti Shockmount** - EOL’d but they have a newer one called a [Radius III](https://www.bluemic.com/en-us/accessories/). 
* **Sony MDR7506** Wired Headphones. I have a extension cable running from my mic around to the underside of my desk, and then the headphones plug into that, to keep my desk fairly cable free.
* **VocalBeat Foam Windscreen for Blue Yeti** - the best $15 I have ever spent on my desk AV set up.
* **[Caldigit Element USB4 Hub](https://www.caldigit.com/thunderbolt-4-element-hub/ )**: I just upgraded my hub, and now when I switch computers, it's one USB-C cable for everything.

I run my keyboard and trackpad in wired mode to make swapping computers easier, and to just never have to worry about charging them.
