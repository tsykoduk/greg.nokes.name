<blockquote>'God is weak and powerless in the world, and that is exactly the way, the only way, in which he can be with us and help us.â€</blockquote>

<p>Father Bonhoeffer (Saint? he was martyred I don't know what that would make him) seems to have been a very thoughtful man. He wrote of a 'Religionless Christianity', but did not have time to expand on it during his short life.</p>


<p>A Powerless God is a fascinating line of thought. It really explains a lot about how the world seems to work. Taking the view that God cannot have power in this world, he could exist out side of the time stream, and many paradoxes go away.</p>


<p>But then why God? If he is indeed powerless, how can he communicate his will to us? If he is powerless what use is he, can he even forgive sin? With no power, how could he have caused the bible to be written, and rewritten by so many people with out error?</p>


<p>I guess that one of my problems with the philosophy behind modern Christianity is that of Original Sin. You are condemned to some eternal punishment, unless you ask for forgiveness. It seems like a problem was created just so that we would be beholden to God. Why even put the 'Tree of Knowledge' in the Garden to tempt Adam and Eve? We are told by many of the Christians out there that with out belief in God, we are dammed to Hell. Not really a nice, loving though.</p>


<p>To me, If there is a God, he should appreciate good works. Even if we do not give him homage. If we practice love and oppose evil, should he not welcome us? If he is such a petty God that he would not love us for who we are if we do not pay lip service to him... well, He would not be worth my respect.</p>


<p>I choose not to believe that. Since faith is belief in something that cannot be proven or disproved, I choose to believe that God's Infinite Love&#8482; allows him to look into our souls and see what kind of person we are. If he in fact exists, after I die, he will see that I was mostly good, mostly harmless and usually attempted to act with my and others best interest in mind. I also choose to believe in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_Spaghetti_Monster"><span class="caps">FSM</span></a>.</p>
