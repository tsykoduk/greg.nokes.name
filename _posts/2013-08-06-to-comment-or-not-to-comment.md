One of the trends that I personally have noticed is the removal of the ability to comment from articles on blogs. I'm not sure which camp I'm in,  so I decided to preform an experiment. I turned off comments on the last few articles that I have posted, just to see how that makes me feel.

Honestly, I feel like I'm missing something. I really feel like comments power three positive things - increased visibility for the commenters, discourse and article stickiness. I also understand the drawbacks - including trolling, spamming and all of the nastiness that comes with that. Also, you increase the surface of attack by opening up your site to comments.

I guess that I kind of miss the heyday of blogging for me - back in 2005 - 2007 when the comments flowed freely.

Since I hate making choices, I thought that I'd just open it up, turn on comments on this article and see if anyone actually has an opinion about it.
