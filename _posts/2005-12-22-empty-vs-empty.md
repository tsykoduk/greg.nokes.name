Justus posed an interesting question in a comment. I really felt that it needed more then just a comment in reply, as sometimes the paradox itself is central to the lesson
<blockquote>But shouldn't we become childlike instead of knowing things like that we are insignifigant?</blockquote>
Yes.

<p>Also:</p>


<p>No.</p>


<p>It's deep man, but you have to balance your emptiness with fullness. It's like this:</p>


<p>My mind is like a cup. If it holds (heh) one cup, and I put a cup of Schnapps in it, it is full, correct?</p>


<p>What if I could make the cup larger? Make the cup hold 10 cups? Is it full now? Is is empty? Closer to which one? What if I made it able to hold 1000 cups of liquid?</p>


<p>Our minds are like that. They are elastic, can stretch and bend and wiggle. If you work yours out, then you can stretch it to accept new ideas. If you are locked into one mode of thought, then your mind will become like a steel trap - rusted shut.</p>


<p>The emptiness/fullness is just an analogy to reality - and a simple one at that. But it is very useful in teaching. We would never expect some one to unlearn everything that they ever knew to become truly empty. Rather, it's a way of looking at the world as created new each second. Not letting past experiences limit your outlook now.</p>
