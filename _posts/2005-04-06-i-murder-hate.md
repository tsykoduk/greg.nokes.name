>I MURDER hate by flood or field,
>Tho' glory's name may screen us;
>In wars at home I'll spend my blood
>Life-giving wars of Venus.
>The deities that I adore
>Are social Peace and Plenty;
>I'm better pleas'd to make one more,
>Than be the death of twenty.

Robert Burns (1759,1796), [I Murder Hate](http://www.bartleby.com/6/304.html)
