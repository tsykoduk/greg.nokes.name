description: "Personal career transition announcement - leaving 8-year government position in Spokane for new opportunity. Professional milestone and life change story."
---
<p>Well, today was my last day on the government contract. I decided to move on, and pursue a fantastic opportunity which came along. Leaving was really hard. I had worked at the same office for 5 years, and for the same agency in Spokane for 8 years. I have a lot of friends there, but it was time to move on.</p>


<p>I will be posting more about what I am going to be doing in the next few weeks, so stay tuned!</p>
