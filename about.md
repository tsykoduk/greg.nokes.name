I build systems. Some run on servers, some run on teams, and most of the interesting work lives in the overlap. I care about tools that make people feel competent, policies that don't get in the way, and small choices that quietly shape how we work together.

This site is where I think out loud about that overlap. Expect posts on how tech affects behavior, why we reach for complexity when we don't need it, desk setups that reduce friction, and the occasional bit of philosophy that survived contact with a real workday.

Nothing here is a lesson. It's more like field notes: what I noticed, what broke, what surprised me, and what might be worth doing differently next time.

I've been [tsykoduk](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=tsykoduk) online since the BBS era - find me on Bluesky, Threads, and Mastodon under that handle. Three decades of building systems, most of it self-taught, all of it alongside good people. I spend a lot of time in constrained spaces, and I've learned to find joy there - whether that's optimizing infrastructure, finding the racing line, or figuring out how to communicate clearly when stakes are high.

If you’re curious about what this looks like in practice (or want to swap war-stories), you’ll find me on Mastodon, Bluesky or Threads.
