<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>When Microsoft Corp. shipped the <span class="caps">MS05</span>-039 bulletin on Aug. 9 to patch a "critical" flaw in the Windows Plug and Play service, there was general feeling of trepidation within the Microsoft Security Response Center.</blockquote>

	<p>-<a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,1852594,00.asp">Inside Microsoft's Zotob Situation Room</a> by eWeek</p>


	<p>What amazes me, is how much work is generated by this kind of event. I know that it impacted my work week significantly. Microsoft has made some large claims about the security of Windows Vista - honestly I hope that they are at least half true.</p>


	<p>The problem is that folks are getting sick of the upgrade cycle. I for one, want a machine that is going to do what I need for the next couple of years. I do not want to have a pay $$ for a new machine to run a new OS every few years - and I doubt that any enterprises will either.</p>


	<p>Another problem is that folks look at Windows 98, 2000, and XP (or what ever is installed on their machines) and they think that it's good enough. Why pay through the nose for a new OS that might or might now have any new features that are actually needed?</p>


	<p>In my never-so humble opinion, we are going to see a great slow down on upgrading. There is going to come a time when a 1/2 gigahertz jump in processor speed and some new glitzy featurette in the OS will not cause people to buy new computers.</p>


	<p>Would you buy a new refrigerator if it got 3 degrees colder inside? Computing is going to become an integral part of life - it's going to be like the toaster. It just will work, and be tied into our entertainment, communications and lives in ways that we cannot dream right now.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>In general, terrorism is a violent tool in a political struggle, where one side is overmatched in conventional terms. Robert Pape, author of the new book, Dying to Win, reviewed 315 suicide bombing attacks between 1983 and 2003 and found that virtually all of them had "a specific secular and strategic goal: to compel democracies to withdraw military forces from the terrorists' national homeland."</blockquote>

	<p>and</p>


<blockquote> Observes Robert Pape: "Since suicide terrorism is mainly a response to foreign occupation and not Islamic fundamentalism, the use of heavy military force to transform Muslim societies over there, if you would, is only likely to increase the number of suicide terrorists coming at us... Suicide terrorism is not a supply-limited phenomenon where there are just a few hundred around the world willing to do it because they are religious fanatics. It is a demand-driven phenomenon."</blockquote>

	<p>-<a href="http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=4312">Cato</a></p>


	<p>I guess that this is the crux of the matter. Now days, we are paying the price for years of mismangment of foriegn affairs by ourselves and the Eurpoeans. There are real reasons that we are hated in portions of the world. It's not just because we are wealthy (altho that does not help) and it's not because we are of a diffrent religion. It's because of our hubris.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Saying that they want democracies to withdraw forces from their 'national homeland' is so vague as to be useless.

It could be used to describe just about anything that is done against a democracy.

Bin Laden, for example, was most enraged about our bases in Saudi Arabia.  These bases were there with the agreement of the Saudi Government, the U.S. was certainly not 'occupying' Saudi Arabia.

Of course the Madrid bombings, although not suicide bombings, were partially justified by a demand for the withdrawal of all Spanish military forces from the Islamic land of Al-Andalusia.

It might be instructive to think about why Bin Laden, who disliked U.S. military bases in Saudi acted differently than, for example, fringe groups in Germany who dislike our military bases there.

It might also be instructive to think about why Bin Laden dislike U.S. bases in Saudi Arabia in the first place.  We certainly weren't directly oppressing the Saudi people with our military.  We were perhaps 'polluting sacred groud' but if that is the reason it would be a religious motivation, contrary to the point of these quotes.  One can also look at claims that 'globalization' is causing culteral pollution, but that ends up being both a core hatred of freedom and a belief in religious ideology to an extraordinary degree.

In the case of Saudi, one could argue that the Saudi Government itself is corrupt and we are facilitating it in oppressing its own people.  I would have sympathy for that arguement, but not from Bin Laden.  We have seen his ideal state in Taliban Afghanistan, and it is apparent that he feels that the Saudis allow too much, not too little, freedom for the Saudi people.


As for the idea that the way to defeat this tactic is to give into their demands, it is probably true that it would work.  If the mere threat of a suicide attack would cause capitulation to any demands, then I presume that no actual suicide attacks would take place.  That of course doesn't make this a particularly unique situation.  If the threat of any military tactic would promote such dramatic capitulation, the threat would be sufficient and that particular tactic would never need to be used.]]></wp:comment_content>

<title>Windows reaches the 30 billion mark</title>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,4149,1210067,00.asp">Dvorak</a>:</p>


<blockquote>I think that when we put all the numbers together, we can estimate that there are a minimum of 30 billion Windows system crashes a year.</blockquote>

	<p>Read the article - it has some really good points - like 30 billion is the number of stars in the Milky Way.</p>


	<p>Why do people take this?</p>


<blockquote>Gates said that 5 percent of Windows machines crash, on average, twice daily.</blockquote>

	<p>And yet people still run out to buy it. It's like this:</p>


	<p>I go and buy a <a href="http://www.vw.com/passat/index.html">Car</a>. But I have to pay extra for the Tires, the Paint, the Keys (and locks). When you buy a Windows computer - what do you do? You run out and buy <a href="http://www.antivirus.com">Anti-Virus</a>, <a href="http://www.openoffice.org">Office</a>, <a href="http://www.zonelabs.com/">Firewalls</a>, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=321CD7A2-6A57-4C57-A8BD-DBF62EDA9671&#38;displaylang=en">spyware killers</a>. You download and install a host of third party apps (<a href="<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/">FireFox, thunderbird</a>, <a href="http://www.openoffice.org">Open Office</a>) because the ones that come with Windows are, well, less the perfect (Wordpad, anyone?). You get the <a href="http://desktop.google.com/?promo=mp-gds-v1-1">Google Desktop</a> so that you can efficiently search your machine, you get a <a href="http://toolbar.google.com/">pop-up-blocker</a>, you spend about 6 hours running <a href="http://update.microsoft.com">updates</a>.</p>


	<p>Oh - and by the way - half of the features that were going to be added to Windows Vista, well, they had to <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/04/08/27/HNlonghornadvances_1.html">drop</a> them because they did not think that they could get them working by '06 or '07.</p>


	<p>It's like selling a car with out the tires, locks, keys, and paint. We would not stand for that - any car dealership that tried that would be drummed right into Chapter 13. And yet, some of us expect it from our computer stores.</p>


	<p>And don't forget that all of this downloading has to be done quick. The average time a vanilla windows box can be connected to the internet with out being compromised is up to a record <a href="http://blogs.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2005/06/windows_surviva.html">40 minutes</a>. I want to trust my business and money to this OS, don't you?</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4823346"> War Reporting for Cowards</a> NPR does a really interesting radio report about Chris Ayres, a self-described "neurotic, Gen-X hypochondriac," who ended up embedded in a Marine unit during the invasion of Iraq. He details out some of the hardships that he faced - like picking out a tent. A must listen!</p>]]></content:encoded>

	<p>This is a must read, if you are Ma, Pa or in the Industry. What scares me the most is the line "<i>we have built a society and our national defense upon systems that we know are going to religiously fail for countless reasons</i>".</p>

<title>Howl and Bonjour, Together Forever!</title>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So - as my regular readers know, I have <a href="http://www.apple.com/switch/">switched</a> from Linux for my main OS at home. One of the reasons I jumped to Linux was due to my frustration with Windows 98's issues. Yeah - that kind of dates me. My journey with Linux was wonderful. I still love the OS. However after the second Ink jet that I got failed to work with parts of it, I gave up. I work on problematic computers at work (windows 2000 mainly) and I really Just Wanted Stuff to Work at home.</p>


	<p>Enter Mac <span class="caps">OS X</span>. The hardware was sexy (even before this Switch, I wanted a PowerBook), and the promise of stuff just working was really enticing. So, I got a Mac Mini. Even before I had left the store, I had bumped the <span class="caps">RAM</span> to 1 gig (the most it could handle). Got it home, and was like a kid at christmas.</p>


	<p>First step - use the included CD to upgrade to Tiger. No problem. Worked right out of the box. Well, after a month of using Tiger and the Mini, I had made up my mind. Next was the Powerbook. Sweet machine. really sweet.</p>


	<p>Anyways, to bring this back onto topic, I was left with several linux boxes laying about the house. I sold one to a friend for use as a firewall (nudge, nudge?). One was left behind (future web-server for the house) and the 1.6 gig machine was sitting, all alone. Busted out a new 250g <span class="caps">HDD</span> for it, and slapped it in. (Gawd, I love linux. Had it installed, configured, formated and data copied in about 10 minutes).</p>


	<p>Now, the hard part. How to make Linux speak Mac. After some research, I found that Mac uses <span class="caps">AFP</span> (still) as their native file sharing protocol. Bonjour is used to discover services on the fly. So, my linux box needed to speak those two languages.</p>


	<p>(warning - geekspeak follows!)
&lt;!<del>-more</del>-&gt;</p>


	<p>The Linux Box: Dell 1.6g <span class="caps">P4 768</span> megs <span class="caps">RAM</span>, 1 20g <span class="caps">HDD</span> (/, boot, home, usr, var, etc) 1 250g <span class="caps">HDD</span> (/share). 1 Netgear 10/100/1000 <span class="caps">NIC</span>. Ubuntu Linux - Hoary Hedgehog all security patches etc.</p>


	<p>So, first things first, let's let appletalk running. Open Synaptic, and get netatalk. install it. presto.</p>


	<p>Edit the /etc/default/netatalk file and turn off everything except afp</p>


	<p>Next, we need to install Bonjour - called Howl under Linux. So, get howl-utils and mdnsresponder.</p>


	<p>Edit the /etc/mdnsresponder/mDNSresponder.conf file and add a few lines to define your services</p>


	<p>Add the services that you need - the one thing that took me a while to figure out is that afp is called afpovertcp and you need to put a .local after the servername</p>


	<p>Restart both /etc/init.d/netatalk and mdnsresponder</p>


	<p>That should do it for you.</p>


	<p>There are some good howtos out there - I like this <a href="http://viebrock.ca/article/22/file-sharing-from-linux-to-os-x-a-quick-guide">one</a>  quite a bit. Google is your friend!</p>


	<p>I've been giving the protocol stack a good workout - I had 3 copies going at once (a 13 gig, a 5 gig and a 500 meg) and the box just keeps slurping it up.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It turns out that 16 nuclear reactors were discovered in <a href="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap021016.html">Oklo, Africa</a>. The surprising part is that they are from 2 <strong>billion</strong> years ago.</p>


	<p>That is not a typo.</p>


	<p>They have come up with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklo">theories</a> showing how they might have formed naturally - but come on.</p>


	<p>Our recorded history only stretches back a few thousand years. From what we can glean looking at old fossils and such, we have been around for a few hundred thousand years.</p>


	<p>Who is to say what came before us? Our racial lifespan is like the blink of an eye in the life of this planet. What blinks have come before us? What blinks will come after?</p>


	<p>What traces of us will be there in 2 billion years?</p>]]></content:encoded>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>A man I knew died today.

	<p>I was working late when the news came in. It was a heart attack at around noon. He was 57 years old, and just retired a month earlier.</p>


	<p>He was a good man, who enjoyed life, people, and a good laugh.</p>


	<p>When visiting him at his desk I was always amazed at his knowledge, and his outlook on life. He enjoyed reading, and seemed to know everything about history and religion. Because of this I often tried to coax him into joining my website so we could dive deep into discussions, but he was never much of a computer person.</p>


	<p>On the day he retired he was given a large red rocking chair, and looked very at home sitting in it with a grin from ear to ear.</p>


	<p>Although I have only known him for about three years, the news of his passing hit me like a 2&#215;4 between the eyes. I liked him, enjoyed his company, and welcomed his manner as he spoke about life and living.</p>


	<p>Someone was removed from life who really enjoyed it and there is no amount of pondering that can explain why. There is never any rhyme or reason when it comes to death. The man is gone, but his life will forever be remembered by those of us he has associated with.</p>


	<p>The important thing is that this man was loved by many, and had touched more lives then I could explain here. I know that for the rest of my days I will always remember the brief time we had spent together locked in debate about life, the universe, and everything.</p>


	<p>It was an honor to know this man, and to get to share in his wisdom if only for a short time. Would he have known of the impact he left in my life just from our acquaintance? Probably not, but then again, I believe it shows that how you live your life day to day can affect many people you would not even think of.</p>


	<p>Go out into the world to work and play. Spend as much time with your family as you can, because each and every day is precious. More importantly, take a moment to remember those who have passed. Not to dwell on the sad times, but reflect on the good times. Think of them and smile. That is what they would want you to do.</p>


	<p>A man I knew died today, and he will be missed.</blockquote></p>


	<p>-<a href="http://www.handbasket.info/News/article/sid=165.html">Life In A Handbasket</a></p>


	<p>The author of Life in A Handbasket is a co-worker of mine, as was the Man who Died yesterday. I knew him for over 5 years. We worked in diffrent areas, but our paths crossed every month or so. I always enjoyed talking with him. He was a great man. One of the few great men that I had ever met.</p>


	<p>My heart goes out to his family.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><span class="caps">SCIENTISTS</span> have created "miracle mice" that can regenerate amputated limbs or damaged vital organs, making them able to recover from injuries that would kill or permanently disable normal animals.

	<p>The experimental animals are unique among mammals in their ability to regrow their heart, toes, joints and tail.</blockquote></p>


	<p>-<a href="http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/common/story_page/0,5744,16417002%255E30417,00.html">The Australian</a></p>


	<p>We all know that 'mice today, people tomorrow'. Imagine the possiblities. Broken wrist that will never heal correctly? Chop it off, and let it regrow new.</p>


	<p>It reminds me of a quote from Firefly.</p>


<blockquote>Wash: "Psychic, though? That sounds like something out of science fiction."

	<p>Zoe: "We live in a space ship, dear."</blockquote></p>


	<p>We are truly living in a spaceship, dear.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote> Who can we blame for building levies that were designed to withstand a cat 3 storm? Who can we blame for sending a cat 5 storm?

	<p>Let's fire God. If you want to push the blame up, and fire the guy who is really responsible, well, God let all of this happen right?</p>


	<p>God must be evil.</p>


	<p>All of this blame and firing crap is just stupid, as the previous few paragraphs tried to point out. Bush is not an evil person. Clinton was (is) not evil. I disagreed with his handling of a lot of things (Somalia, the Balkans, Cigars) however, I did not, and do not, think that he was the devil. When I got the chance, I voted my feelings, and lost (he got a second term). I accepted that. I am a grownup - I know that I do not always get my way.</blockquote></p>


	<p>That is my latest post on <a href="http://emilyscraziness.blogspot.com/2005/09/frustration.html">this</a> comment stream. Good stuff, on a Good Blog!</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>It took four long days for state and federal officials to figure out how to deal with the disaster in New Orleans. I can't blame them, because it also took me four long days to figure out what was going on there. The reason is that the events there make no sense if you think that we are confronting a natural disaster.

	<p>If this is just a natural disaster, the response for public officials is obvious: you bring in food, water, and doctors; you send transportation to evacuate refugees to temporary shelters; you send engineers to stop the flooding and rebuild the city's infrastructure. For journalists, natural disasters also have a familiar pattern: the heroism of ordinary people pulling together to survive; the hard work and dedication of doctors, nurses, and rescue workers; the steps being taken to clean up and rebuild.</p>


	<p>Public officials did not expect that the first thing they would have to do is to send thousands of armed troops in armored vehicle, as if they are suppressing an enemy insurgency. And journalistsâ€”myself includedâ€”did not expect that the story would not be about rain, wind, and flooding, but about rape, murder, and looting.</p>


	<p>But this is not a natural disaster. It is a man-made disaster.</p>


	<p>The man-made disaster is not an inadequate or incompetent response by federal relief agencies, and it was not directly caused by Hurricane Katrina. This is where just about every newspaper and television channel has gotten the story wrong.</p>


	<p>The man-made disaster we are now witnessing in New Orleans did not happen over four days last week. It happened over the past four decades. Hurricane Katrina merely exposed it to public view.</p>


	<p>The man-made disaster is the welfare state. </blockquote></p>


	<p>-<a href="http://tiadaily.com/php-bin/news/showArticle.php?id=1026">An Unnatural Disaster: A Hurricane Exposes the Man-Made Disaster of the Welfare State</a></p>


	<p>Great article, Great read. I highly recommend it.</p>


	<p>People that rely on handouts in normal times will have no idea how to even function under bad conditions. When we train people to be reliant upon the state for all of their needs, when the state cannot help them you end up with tragedies like this one.</p>


<blockquote>What Hurricane Katrina exposed was the psychological consequences of the welfare state. What we consider "normal" behavior in an emergency is behavior that is normal for people who have values and take the responsibility to pursue and protect them. People with values respond to a disaster by fighting against it and doing whatever it takes to overcome the difficulties they face. They don't sit around and complain that the government hasn't taken care of them. They don't use the chaos of a disaster as an opportunity to prey on their fellow men.

	<p>But what about criminals and welfare parasites? Do they worry about saving their houses and property? They don't, because they don't own anything. Do they worry about what is going to happen to their businesses or how they are going to make a living? They never worried about those things before. Do they worry about crime and looting? But living off of stolen wealth is a way of life for them.</blockquote></p>


	<p>Giving people ownership in their lives and communities goes a long way towards encouraging people to act more responsibly. I know for a fact, when I rent an apartment, I treat it differently then when I live in my own house. Why should I care what happens to something that I do not care about?</p>


	<p>I have not seen anyone talking about this - just about the failure of the government to provide for these people. These people should be able to take care of themselves. After all, the federal government has been advising people to make <a href="http://www.ready.gov/index.html"> preparedness kits</a> for years now. But never mind that! Never mind that these people were under prepared to take care of themselves - they just ran into the night, assuming that the Great Government in the sky would save them - and they cried bloody murder (and murder) when that did not happen.</p>


	<p>I am sickened by what happened there. I wish that it had been possible to move more quickly to save these people. However, if they had been at all ready, they could have saved themselves. That is the lesson that we need to take away from this. When it gets really bad - it's not some higher power, it's not some government - it's your responsibility to do everything possible to be civil, civilized and take care of yourself.</p>


	<p>All of that said and done - that is a lesson that we must learn for next time. What we need right now is to save the rest of the folks out there.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>The Six Dumbest Ideas in Computer Security

	<p>There's lots of innovation going on in security - we're inundated with a steady stream of new stuff and it all sounds like it works just great. Every couple of months I'm invited to a new computer security conference, or I'm asked to write a foreword for a new computer security book. And, thanks to the fact that it's a topic of public concern and a "safe issue" for politicians, we can expect a flood of computer security-related legislation from lawmakers. So: computer security is definitely still a "hot topic." But why are we spending all this time and money and still having problems?</p>


	<p>Let me introduce you to the six dumbest ideas in computer security. What are they? They're the anti-good ideas. They're the braindamage that makes your $100,000 <span class="caps">ASIC</span>-based turbo-stateful packet-mulching firewall transparent to hackers. Where do anti-good ideas come from? They come from misguided attempts to do the impossible - which is another way of saying "trying to ignore reality." Frequently those misguided attempts are sincere efforts by well-meaning people or companies who just don't fully understand the situation, but other times it's just a bunch of savvy entrepreneurs with a well-marketed piece of junk they're selling to make a fast buck. In either case, these dumb ideas are the fundamental reason(s) why all that money you spend on information security is going to be wasted, unless you somehow manage to avoid them.</blockquote></p>


	<p>-<a href="http://www.ranum.com/security/computer_security/editorials/dumb/">The six dumbest ideas in Computer Security</a></p>


	<p>I think that a lot of us have been guilty of several of these.</p>


<blockquote>Unless specifically compelled otherwise for legitimate and extenuating reasons, all new computer users should buy a Mac. It makes all of our lives easier. (Read: less customer support from geeks to users.)</blockquote>

	<p>-<a href="http://securityawareness.blogspot.com/2005/09/mad-as-hell-xvi-final-mah.htm">Winn Schwartau</a> <em>Get a better blog! Blogger? Come On! :)</em></p>


	<p>Macs are not the panacea that so many think. Right now they are far far more secure then win-tel, and I think that they will be more secure for the foreseeable future. That does not mean that they are invincible. Macs can get hacked just like any other machine. However, since they have more security in mind when they were coded, I will bet my $$ on them and Linux for the time being. But - if Macs turn to crap and Linux implodes, you will see me gritting my teeth and going Windows.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>If you get a call from someone claiming to be a local court worker claiming you failed to report for jury duty, and you haven't been asked to serve, red flags should go up in your head immediately, state officials warn.

	<p>According to a consumer alert from the office of Tom Gallagher, the state's chief financial officer, the caller tries to put the victims off-guard by saying an arrest warrant has been issued. When victims say they never received a jury duty notice, the scammer asks for personal information to check their records.</blockquote></p>


	<p>-<a href="http://securityawareness.blogspot.com/2005/09/new-id-theft-scam-raises-red-flags.html">Security Awareness for Ma, Pa and the Corprate Clueless</a></p>


	<p>You know, I am amazed how often these things happen. It's not that hard folks. Just verify their story. If some one calls you claiming to be from the Court, how about getting their name and information and calling the courthouse back? You can even play it off. Say that you are on the other line, and you need to take a message. Take the message and check it out.</p>


	<p>I was interviewed for a security position that I did not get awhile back. I am not certified in computer security, and honestly, I do not see the reason to get certified. It's just common sense to me. One of the topics that was brought up in the interview was single firewall crust defense vs a layered defense.</p>


	<p>A crust defense is when you have a defensive measure at the gateway. Sort of like a sentry that watches all traffic coming and going. A layered defense is when you have that sentry, but also have guards patrolling around inside as well. In computer speak - a crust defense would have a firewall at your connection to the rest of the world. A layered defense would have that firewall, and also firewalls on all of the machines inside of the network, and firewalls on connections to other remote sites internal to your network.</p>


	<p>Layering works well when you switch up the firewall vendors as well. For example - have brand X at the gateway, and then brand Y at all internal connections and brand Z on your machines. If any one of the brands develops a problem, you are still safe. Also, if a hacker cuts through your first layers of defense, give him another problem, rather then just more of the same.</p>


	<p>I don't know if I am special or not, but that just makes sense to me. The more layers of defense that the bad guys have to get through to get to your stuff the better. Security really is no more then common sense taken and applied to real world problems.</p>


<blockquote>Sometimes it seems like the people in charge of homeland security spend too much time watching action movies. They defend against specific movie plots instead of against the broad threats of terrorism.

	<p>We all do it. Our imaginations run wild with detailed and specific threats. We imagine anthrax spread from crop dusters. Or a contaminated milk supply. Or terrorist scuba divers armed with almanacs. Before
long, we're envisioning an entire movie plot, without Bruce Willis saving the day. And we're scared.</p>


	<p>Psychologically, this all makes sense. Humans have good imaginations. Box cutters and shoe bombs conjure vivid mental images. "We must protect the Super Bowl" packs more emotional punch than the vague "we should defend ourselves against terrorism."</p>


	<p>The 9/11 terrorists used small pointy things to take over airplanes, so we ban small pointy things from airplanes. Richard Reid tried to hide a bomb in his shoes, so now we all have to take off our shoes. Recently, the Department of Homeland Security said that it might relax airplane security rules. It's not that there's a lessened risk of shoes, or that small pointy things are suddenly less dangerous. It's that those movie plots no longer capture the imagination like they did in the months after 9/11, and everyone is beginning to see how silly (or pointless) they always were.</blockquote></p>


	<p>and</p>


<blockquote>We need to defend against the broad threat of terrorism, not against specific movie plots. Security is most effective when it doesn't make arbitrary assumptions about the next terrorist act. We need to spend more money on intelligence and investigation: identifying the terrorists themselves, cutting off their funding, and stopping them regardless of what their plans are. We need to spend more money on
emergency response: lessening the impact of a terrorist attack, regardless of what it is. And we need to face the geopolitical consequences of our foreign policy and how it helps or hinders terrorism.</blockquote>

	<p>-<a href="http://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram-0509.html">Cryptogram</a> by <a href="http://www.schneier.com/">Bruce Schneier</a></p>


	<p>Too often people get caught up in the minutia of security. The banning of pointy objects on planes, or installing a '<em>$100,000 <span class="caps">ASIC</span>-based turbo-stateful packet-mulching firewall</em>'. They miss the secretary sitting two cubes down that just got a call from 'Ted' in at the Help desk and gave him her password and login information, not to mention her Social Security number and home address. They miss the bus with a bomb in it because they are worried about protecting airports.</p>


	<p>Any time that you declare that you only have to protect this point in space, there will be others that look for other ways in. To be truly secure, we need to step back, and take a broader view.</p>


	<p>For example - take my home network. I have a firewall at my gateway. I also have a firewall running on every machine that is on the network. I am not really concerned with virus attacks, but I run a program to sweep my machines free of virus infestations every night. I make backups of my information onto multiple computers.</p>


	<p>If I followed the views of some, I would simply put a firewall on my gateway and call it good. Not good enough. I value my data, and my time.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[An excellent post. All the security in the world is worthless if you just hold the door open to the bad guys.

I'd tell the person on the phone to come arrest me. When do the police call you and tell you that there is a warrant out for your arrest? haha.

Great advice, but are people listening?]]></wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>O'Reilly (Ho, <a href="http://www.ci.sebastopol.ca.us/">Sebastopol!)</a> has a really good interview with Alan Cox about where computer security is going.</p>


<blockquote>It is beginning to improve, but at the moment computer security is rather basic and mostly reactive. Systems fail absolutely rather than degrade. We are still in a world where an attack like the slammer worm combined with a <span class="caps">PC BIOS</span> eraser or disk locking tool could wipe out half the PCs exposed to the internet in a few hours. In a sense we are fortunate that most attackers want to control and use systems they attack rather than destroy them.</blockquote>

	<p>-<a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/network/2005/09/12/alan-cox.html?page=1">Alan Cox</a></p>


	<p>If you are at all interested in computer security, I recommend that you go and read this.</p>


	<p>Here is my take:</p>


	<p>A lot of what he says is accurate. By increasing the sophistication of the programmers toolkit, and making it more 'bug aware', I think that the average quality of code will increase. More quality code will mean less holes.</p>


	<p>However, it's more then just well written code. There are several other layers to this. First off, how much interaction between parts of the computer do we allow? Do we allow your web browser to read your address book? Do we allow the web browser to create files on your local machine? This interaction can be dangerous, and exploited. As we build more complex bounds checking on the actions that any one application can take, we increase the complexity of the code, and make the programmers life harder.</p>


	<p>I think that the new tools that Alan talked about will end up just keeping the status quo. As the code gets more and more complex, and we need communication channels between different applications on a machine,or across the network, it's going to become harder and harder to think of every method that could be used to hijack a process and use it for ill.</p>


	<p>It's going to be an arms race. White hats vs black hats. It's been that way for a long time, and it's only going to increase. What has changed is the amount of interconnectedness in the world, and the fact that 90% of those machines are running a joke of an Operating System.</p>


	<p>Certain large software companies have convinced us that we need to have large amounts of interaction between all of our applications, all of the time. I do not know if this is as true as some think. Interaction is good, however it needs to be regulated by the user. Users also should not be able to make certain modifications to the machine with out an administrators approval.</p>


	<p>Under Linux and Mac <span class="caps">OS X</span>, if you are going to install certain applications (ones that effect the entire OS, and not just your user space) you are prompted for a admin password. That is the way that it should be. Windows (2k and above) will fail to install, saying that you must have admin rights. The problem is that, under windows, 99% of the users are admins on their machines. With all of the remote exploits for Windows, it really does not matter, as you no longer have to actually install bad code, you can just get it like you get a cold.</p>


	<p>If Windows were to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbox_%28computer_security%29">sandbox</a> the user space in better, then most of these issues would not be issues. If you are logged in, and you visit a evil web page that tries to install evil spy ware, if windows sandboxed the userspace your machine would be o.k. There are just so many processes running in the background in windows, trying to make your life easier for you, that the evil software piggybacks off of one of them, and presto - you are infected.</p>


	<p>In the mean time - if you are buying a new computer, get a <a href="http://www.apple.com">Mac.</a> Practice <a href="https://greg.nokes.name/safe.jpg">safe computing</a>! Be careful out there!</p>]]></content:encoded>

No, Vista will be out next year.

Vista will be out next year. Vista has never been delayed. I mean, we had earlier conceptualizations, but the thing that is Vista is on its track. </blockquote></p>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I've made the point before, that we don't really know much at all about gravity, or even have very good theories for it.

However, if you were to say that Gravity is a manifestation of God's love, and as he created all of the universe all the parts of it are attracted as described in the following equation:

F(gl)= GL * Ma * Mb / r2

Where Ma is the mass of object A, Mb is the mass of object b, r is the distance in meters between them, F(gl) is the magnitude of the force of God's Love between the two objects and GL is the constant of God's Love.

You can do the physics all day long with that construction.  It workes exactly as well as what we have now, and is not really any more mysterious.]]></wp:comment_content>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>Morning Edition, September 22, 2005 Â· Federal troops assisting local governments with disaster relief are not allowed to engage in law enforcement, according to the 1878 law known as the Posse Comitatus Act. But the Bush administration, the Pentagon and members of Congress are considering loosening that longstanding restriction.</blockquote>

	<p>-<a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4858832"><span class="caps">NPR</span></a></p>


	<p>This might be a really scary thing, if they are in fact talking about allowing federal troops to operate as Law Enforcement in the U.S. While I do not think that this administration would abuse those powers, I am not as confident that all of the administrations in the future would be as trustworthy. If the current administration does start to ask for these powers, I will be greatly troubled.</p>


<blockquote> Whoever, except in cases and under circumstances expressly authorized by the Constitution or Act of Congress, willfully uses any part of the Army or the Air Force as a posse comitatus or otherwise to execute the laws shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than two years, or both.</blockquote>

	<p>-<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posse_Comitatus_Act">Wikipedia</a></p>


	<p>Evidently, it can be overridden in certain cases, such as:</p>


<blockquote>    * National Guard units while under the authority of the governor of a state;<br />
    * Troops when used pursuant to the Federal authority to quell domestic violence as was the case during the 1992 Los Angeles riots;<br />
    * The President of the United States can waive this law in an emergency;<br />
    * In December 1981 additional laws were enacted (codified 10 <span class="caps">USC 371</span>-78) clarifying permissible military assistance to civilian law enforcement agenciesâ€”including the Coast Guardâ€”especially in combating drug smuggling into the United States. Posse Comitatus clarifications emphasize supportive and technical assistance (e.g., use of facilities, vessels, aircraft, intelligence, tech aid, surveillance) while generally prohibiting direct participation of Department of Defense personnel in law enforcement (e.g., search, seizure, and arrests). For example, Coast Guard Law Enforcement Detachments (LEDETS) serve aboard Navy vessels and perform the actual boardings of interdicted suspect drug smuggling vessels and, if needed, arrest their crews.<br />
    * Under 18 <span class="caps">USC 831</span>, the Attorney General may request that the Secretary of Defense provide emergency assistance if civilian law enforcement is inadequate to address certain types of threat involving the release of nuclear materials, such as potential use of a Nuclear or Radiological weapon. Such assistance may be by any personnel under the authority of the Department of Defense, provided such assistance does not adversely affect US military preparedness.</blockquote>

	<p>-Again, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posse_Comitatus_Act">Wikipedia</a></p>


	<p>So, it sounds like the president can overcome the act anyways. However, the more layers of red tape between the office of the president and the ability to order our troops to act on our soil in a law enforcement or military manner the better.</p>


	<p>I whole-heartily support the Posse Comitatus Act, and would urge folks to contact their representatives and make sure that they stand for the separation of powers that the constitution guarantees us.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[If we are just talking about loosening this restriction when troops are engaging in disaster relief, I don't have a problem with that.

Basically, what it would mean is without a specific order from the president, troops engaging in this sort of operation could engage in law enforcement duties.  Not necessarily a bad idea.

If it is a more general relaxation, I agree with you]]></wp:comment_content>

	<p>Father Bonhoeffer (Saint? he was martyred I don't know what that would make him) seems to have been a very thoughtful man. He wrote of a 'Religionless Christianity', but did not have time to expand on it during his short life.</p>


	<p>A Powerless God is a fascinating line of thought. It really explains a lot about how the world seems to work. Taking the view that God cannot have power in this world, he could exist out side of the time stream, and many paradoxes go away.</p>


	<p>But then why God? If he is indeed powerless, how can he communicate his will to us? If he is powerless what use is he, can he even forgive sin? With no power, how could he have caused the bible to be written, and rewritten by so many people with out error?</p>


	<p>I guess that one of my problems with the philosophy behind modern Christianity is that of Original Sin. You are condemned to some eternal punishment, unless you ask for forgiveness. It seems like a problem was created just so that we would be beholden to God. Why even put the 'Tree of Knowledge' in the Garden to tempt Adam and Eve? We are told by many of the Christians out there that with out belief in God, we are dammed to Hell. Not really a nice, loving though.</p>


	<p>To me, If there is a God, he should appreciate good works. Even if we do not give him homage. If we practice love and oppose evil, should he not welcome us? If he is such a petty God that he would not love us for who we are if we do not pay lip service to him... well, He would not be worth my respect.</p>


	<p>I choose not to believe that. Since faith is belief in something that cannot be proven or disproved, I choose to believe that God's Infinite Love&#8482; allows him to look into our souls and see what kind of person we are. If he in fact exists, after I die, he will see that I was mostly good, mostly harmless and usually attempted to act with my and others best interest in mind. I also choose to believe in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_Spaghetti_Monster"><span class="caps">FSM</span></a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[As with my Buddhist leanings. One of the things that I like most about the philosophy that I am trying to learn is how universal it is. It's like the Buddha took the teachings of all of the positive religions in the world and extracted just the core teachings. Love one an another. Work towards being as happy as you can, but accept suffering and loss because it's part of life. With a positive outlook, your emotional state will be much better.

It's all really simple stuff, but some most people just don't &quot;&lt;em&gt;get it&lt;/em&gt;&quot;. I have been a people watcher most of my life - an observer rather then a do-er. What all of that observation has taught me is that people who have a negative outlook, people who grouse and complain, who expect others to conform to their wishes tend to be unhappy.

The &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiccan_Rede&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Wiccan Rede&lt;/a&gt; sums it up: &lt;em&gt;An it harm none, do as thou wilt&lt;/em&gt;. People who hurt other people generally are either not happy, or very sick. It seems that in our psyche there is a hardwiring of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;karma&lt;/a&gt;. As we are negative to others, we get that same treatment in return. We become bitter and unhappy. There is enough suffering in this world with out creating more.

People that expect others to conform to their wishes and desires forget that those others are not objects, but rather are living creatures just like they are. They might follow your command for a time, but they will let you down. Why walk that path to eventual disappointment?]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[While I don't think Christian theology can support the concept of a god that is powerless, it certainly supports the concept of a God that limits the use of his power.  The only way mankind can have free will (which is certainly disputed in some Christian theology) is if God intentionally limits his power, either on a constant basis (as much Christian theology would argue) or in the initial creation of the universe, which would be a Deist belief.

A God with self-limited power, who chooses only to engage his power in certain ways and at certain times, very neatly explains the 'problem of evil' and yet allows of an omnipotent and good being.

I disagree with the concept of 'Orinial Sin,' except as the related concept 'Knowledge of Good and Evil' applies to it.  Without consciousness, there can be no sin.  A shark does not sin, even when he eats a person, but a man may sin when he kills a shark.  In Christian mythology, Adam (and Eve) chose the capability of sin, and since we are capable of sin and none of us are perfect, we are all sinners.  An fundamental part of humanity is our sins and how we deal with them.

This is where I have me exception with the Wiccan Rede.  It seems to me that it is perhaps the beginning, but hardly the end, of morality.  As &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.quotationspage.com/quote/2298.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Edmund Burke&lt;/a&gt; said:  &quot;All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing.&quot;

Evil will exist in the world.  It must be oppossed both within ourselves, and at times external to ourselves.  Sometimes, and very rarely, God may smite evil in the world.  More often he relies on good men, who are not content to merely not harm anyone.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I think that Christian Theology indeed can support a god with out power after all

&lt;em&gt;Bonhoeffer's letters and papers from prison included vague statements that have intrigued many theologians, including a remark about a &quot;religionless Christianity&quot;. It is unknown what Bonhoeffer exactly meant by this and other ideas, but they have sparked a movement in Christian theology labeled, &quot;Secular Theology&quot; popularized by Harvey Cox's book, &quot;The Secular City.&quot; Christian theologians since Bonhoeffer have been struggling with how to construct a theology for what Bonhoeffer called, &quot;a world come of age.&quot; &lt;strong&gt;Bonhoeffer is one of the few theologians who are embraced by both liberal and conservative Christians&lt;/strong&gt;. It is universally agreed that, with his death, the world lost one of the most insightful theological minds.&lt;/em&gt;

--&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietrich_Bonhoeffer&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; (emphasis mine)

If God is indeed omnipotent, and he is good, but he chooses to limit his power to allow suffering and pain, then he fails your own test of the Wiccan Rede. He would have the power to change things however he has chosen not to. Being all knowing, he would have known the outcome of the universe before he created it, and yet he still did.

If you had the power to stop a death - say some one was trapped in a burning car and you just watched them die with a fire hose in your hand - would that not be an evil act? The police would certainly think that you were guilty of negligent homicide.

If God in fact is all powerful, and all knowing, then he is guilty of mass negligent homicide. There are literally millions of people that he could have saved. If, as you posit he chooses not to - that is the definition of negligent homicide.

So, it would be much better if, by creating this universe with free willed creatures in it, he made a place that he could not act. He would watch in horror at the things that his children have done to one and another - but he could not lift a finger to help. Not a place that I would want to be.

Perhaps there is a 'finish line' when he takes the reigns again - judgement day as it were.

I could stomach a God like that. My question is why the church has not embraced this though process and talked more about it. I think that it would help people deal with thinks like we have seen over the last few years better, knowing that God hates this as much as we do - he is just bound by the law of the universe and he is waiting for the day that he can come back and make all right.

I dunno - just rambling on :)]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The Church (Churches really) have been dealing with this issue for a long time.  It is known as 'the problem of evil' and the basic question is, how can evil exist if God is good.

I would postulate, that 'creating a place where he could not act' doesn't get you out of this problem any more than chosing not to act at specific times does.

My take on the answer to this is twofold:  one is that much of which we view as harm (and correctly) isn't 'harm' in Gods eyes.  For an example, from the perspective of a muscle cell in your arm, exercise is 'harm' as the muscle is torn and damaged.  Of course we know that the muscle will be better off for that, and that exercise is 'good'

The second is that sometimes fixing, or preventing, a harm has worse consequences than the harm itself.  If, for example, our freedom to choose is important, than if God were to constantly interevene and prevent us from being 'evil' that freewill would be destroyed.  Presumably freewill is more important, more 'good' than preventing evil.

I guess the corrolary is would you think it a proper use of the Wiccan Rede to administer drugs to the population to make us all docile and happy if that would largely stop violence?]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[&quot;&lt;em&gt;much of which we view as harm (and correctly) isn't 'harm' in Gods eyes.&lt;/em&gt;&quot;

Allowing torture, rape, and slow painful deaths is not harmful? I agree that we are not in his shoes - but if some one treated their dogs like a all-powerful God treats us, they would have their dogs taken away.

The muscle cell analogy does not fit. Cells do not feel pain, they do not greive for one and another. They do not suffer.

We do. God, having created us with that capacity would know that we had that ablity. It's more like we are his pets. We know that cats and dogs feel pain, sorrow, anger. We take responsiblity for them, and their well being.

Some times we have to do small things that we do not like - like give one a shot. However, we do not burn them alive - or knowingly allow some one else to.

That is the diffrence. A theology based on a powerful God has all of these issues. Evil, Pain, Suffering.

Free will is important. But what about senseless accidents (like Katrina). People suffered needlessly. Natural disasters that are not man made? God put this world in motion with full knowledge that Katrina would happen - if he in fact is all knowing and all powerful. Therefor he is directly responsible for it. He caused it.

Why would a God of 'love' cause such devistation and misery?]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Why would a God of 'love' cause such devistation and misery?

I think because without devastation and misery there can be no triumph or glory.

What do we celebrate about being human?  What makes us amazed at the goodness and glory that it is to be human if it is not overcoming adversity?

Look back in you own life, I expect that like all of us you will find various amounts of pain and sorrow.  Would you give up that pain?  Would you undo it?  I would not.

Our pain, our suffering, our struggles against adversity define who we are.

I think that a God that would take that away, that would keep us in a bubble of painlessness would be the evil God, not the God that lets bad stuff happen because he knows that letting it happen is the greater good.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[So, God could not create a world where we we happy, we had free will and we still experienced triumph and glory? If he has limitless power, then  he could.

You really can't have it both ways - either his power is limited, and he is suffering for his creation, or it's limitless and he is at the very least negligent, if not out right evil.

Some would say that the Devil caused this - again that is limiting his power. If he were truly all-powerful and all-seeing he would have known that the Devil was going to fall, and could have taken steps to halt it - or at least undo the damage that was caused. If the Devil cannot be overridden by God, then there is a limit to His power.

I go back to the argument that a Powerless God would be a better way to explain all of these quandaries.

And - yes obidavekenobi - there are things outside our understanding. However, (if you believe that) God created us with questing and questioning minds then it is our duty to push the bounds of human understanding both in the material realm and the spiritual. Look at electricity. 1000 years ago, if you had shown some one a flashlight, they would have though you a witch. Now days, we understand how they work. For the dark ages person - flashlights were outside of their understanding.

And, why should we differentiate between good works? God him self tells us to not judge others. I say that if someone is doing good, no matter the color of his skin or the book that he bases his life on, he should be supported and thanked. To do any other would be - well - unchristian. :)]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[It is actually consistant to be 'all powerful' and still not be able to do certain things.  That would mean you could do everything that was possible, but still couldn't do the things that were impossible.

It seems to me to be logically impossible for us to both have free will and for God to prevent us from doing evil.  He can have all the power he wants, but he would still have to choose one course or the other.  It seems impossible to me that we could 'triumph' if there was no possibility of failure, that we could 'be good' if we could not also 'be bad.'  The very meaning of these concepts includes the existence of their opposite.

The best explanation of this concept I have ever seen is in the Worthing Saga by Orson Scott Card.  In that book a group of powerful Psychics have removed all pain from the universe, erasing memories of loss and instantly healing any hurt.  Their ancestor emerges from cold sleep and is agast at what they have done, in removing all the pain they have made the lives of everyone meaningless.  It is of course an analogy, but it makes a lot of sense to me.

A powerless god would have either never had power (in which how could he be God?) or deliberately created a universe where he could not intervene.  I still don't understand how deliberately creating a unverse where he could not intervene is any morally different from choosing not to intervene in a universe that he could intervene in?  It doesn't solve the basic question of how God could be 'good' and yet evil exists.

I find the belief that evil is itself a 'good'.  That it's existance makes the world a better place because the struggle gives us meaning.   God could not be good, if he did not allow evil.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[An all powerful being that cannot do the impossible? Then He has limits, and is not &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; powerful. Just Really Powerful.

omipotent means being able to do &lt;strong&gt;anything&lt;/strong&gt;;

&lt;em&gt;omÂ·nipÂ·oÂ·tent (Åm-nÄ­p'É™-tÉ™nt)
adj.
Having unlimited or universal power, authority, or force; all-powerful.&lt;/em&gt;

Universal, unlimited. With out limits. Therefore, if he wanted to create a universe with out suffering that was still 'good' in your mind, he could. He has no limits.

It almost sounds like we agree - God has limits. He is not really omnipotent - just really really powerful.

I agree creating a universe where He could not intervene is a strange thought, but it's the only way that I can find to reconcile Evil, Omnipotence and God.]]></wp:comment_content>

	<p>Luckly this was just in a game - but this poses an intresting thought. In game, terrorists took a plague and spread it all over. I don't know if the terrorists had any agenda besides death and destruction, but what if they had? Could you threaten a <span class="caps">MMOG</span> publisher with acts of in game terror to get some change made? Could they hold you responsible for acts of in game terror?</p>]]></content:encoded>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I think that I am going to try and write an article on a specific portion of Buddhism each week. This will help me learn more, as I am forced to explore the philosophy more and more.</p>


	<p>So, let's start at the beginning.</p>


	<p><strong>The Four Noble Truths</strong></p>


	<p>When the Buddha became enlightened, the first talk that he gave was about the Four Noble Truths. They are:</p>


	<p>1. Dukkha: There is suffering. Suffering is an intrinsic part of life also experienced as dissatisfaction, discontent, unhappiness, impermanence.
2. Samudaya: There is a cause of suffering, which is attachment and desire (tanha).
3. Nirodha: There is a way out of suffering, which is to eliminate attachment and desire.
4. Magga: The path that leads out of suffering is called the Noble Eightfold Path.</p>


	<p>Dukkha sums up our experience.  We have all been unhappy, suffered, been depressed. This is called life. We have had our hearts broken, been passed up for a promotion.  It is summed up nicely in the cliche:</p>


	<p><em><strong>Life sucks and then you die</strong></em></p>


<blockquote>"And what have I taught? 'This is stress... This is the origination of stress... This is the cessation of stress... This is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress': This is what I have taught. And why have I taught these things? Because they are connected with the goal, relate to the rudiments of the holy life, and lead to disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to calm, to direct knowledge, to self-awakening, to Unbinding. This is why I have taught them.

	<p>"Therefore your duty is the contemplation, 'This is stress... This is the origination of stress... This is the cessation of stress.' Your duty is the contemplation, 'This is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress.'"</blockquote></p>


	<p>-<a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/sutta/samyutta/sn56-031.html">Buddha</a></p>


	<p>Realizing that suffering exists is the first step in obtaining happiness. Understanding it is the first step towards real compassion. When we see and understand that Suffering is <em>the</em> common human bond, we can start to feel real compassion. It's sad, but I think that unhappiness is the primary motivator for most people out there. Their actions are trying to fill a void.</p>


	<p>When we are driving, and some one cuts us off - how do we react? Usually we get angry. We say some not to nice things about that person. Compassion is when you try and understand that that person is simply attempting to escape from or mitigate his suffering. Perhaps they are late, and are concerned that they will be in trouble? Perhaps they simply do not care about others, and are only thinking of themselves.</p>


<blockquote>'Hey Jake,â€ I say calling my newest waiter over,â€ check this shit out.â€

	<p>After I relate the story Jake smiles and says, 'When I wake up in the morning you know what I sometimes say to myself?â€</p>


	<p>'What?â€ I reply.</p>


	<p>'I'm gonna win today,â€ he says.</p>


	<p>Jake's words hit me like a thunderbolt. Suddenly I understand why I mixed it up with the guy at the bank.</p>


	<p>'Sometimes you feel like you have to come out on top,â€ I say.</p>


	<p>'Exactly.â€</p>


	<p>'Which, more often than not, is an illusion.â€</p>


	<p>'We're just wired that way I guess,â€ Jake says walking away.</p>


	<p>I'm gonna win today. That's how I felt in the bank. That's how I felt on the highway and in Starbucks. Not a healthy sense of competition or ambition, just a grubby graspy feeling of 'I want what I want when I want it.â€ That attitude is more appropriate for those infants squealing in their Baby Hummers than a grown man.</blockquote></p>


	<p>-<a href="http://waiterrant.net/?p=207">Waiterrant</a></p>


	<p>We are wired to want to win in every interaction with each other. Part of compassion is putting that visceral winning need aside for a time, and trying to understand the other person. The first step along the path is to look deep with in, and comprehend our suffering. To see that all humans have and will suffer. Black, white, brown or purple, humans are an unhappy species.</p>


	<p>Once we have that connection with others, it's easer to see that they are people just like us. People who worry about taxes, work, their love life. People who are not faceless enemies. People who love, laugh, and enjoy time with their children. People who hurt when their parents die. People who are saddened by the senseless death of their friends.</p>


<blockquote>The Pali word, dukkha, means "incapable of satisfying" or "not able to bear or withstand anything": always changing, incapable of truly fulfilling us or making us happy. The sensual world is like that, a vibration in nature. It would, in fact, be terrible if we did find satisfaction in the sensory world because then we wouldn't search beyond it; we'd just be bound to it. However, as we awaken to this dukkha, we begin to find the way out so that we are no longer constantly trapped in sensory consciousness.</blockquote>

	<p>-<a href="http://www.buddhanet.net/4noble.htm">Buddhanet</a></p>


	<p>So many people try to find satisfaction in the sensory world. They use drugs, sex, emotion as a salve for their Dukkha not even knowing that they cannot fill that hole. A pastor of mind used to say that the need for God was a hole that we could not fill. We would try, but the only thing that could fill it was God. I think that knowing about that hole, seeing that hole, and seeing that hole in others is the first step on a long path.</p>


	<p>I have brought up this theory that suffering is universal before, and folks seem to think that it's pessimistic. I disagree. Its like a disease. If we do not know that we are sick, then how can we fix it? People are like that. They suffer, and they do not even really realize it. They do not know that there is a better way out there. Buddhism is all about curing Dukkha. It's not easy, but I think that even a fractional decrease in our collective suffering will be a great thing.</p>


	<p>Homework for the week (Ha! and you thought that you would get off easy?) Meditate on suffering. If you do not meditate, then just think about the suffering in the world. Do not get yourself into a funk! If you start to find yourself focusing your entire week on misery, then get out side, play a game, be with friends. When you start to feel unpleasant thoughts, find their root. Understand them.</p>


	<p>When interacting with people, try and look at them with the compassion that understanding the commonality of suffering allows. Try and imagine yourself consoling them. Feel and emote love towards them.</p>


	<p>Read the first Truth at <a href="http://www.buddhanet.net/4noble.htm">Buddhanet</a></p>


	<p>Tune in next week for the Second Noble Truth...</p>]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I too utilise a method akin to what Obidavekenobi is talking about; it is this: to have your expectations met, lower your expectations.

If you expect people to screw you, you will be harder to screw (figuratively).

I keep this in mind while driving and expect every other driver to ignore road rules, signs and any shade of concern for my welfare - and it's saved my life a few times.

It's not a bleak outlook, as it may sound, only a 'base-line' one. I expect the worst, and anything else is a bonus.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[BTW, thank you for discussing this subject. Buddism is fascinating. I've been meaning to learn more about it when time permits but never seem to get around to it (there might be a lesson in that).

Looking forward to your future posts.

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[This type of philosophy, and it is not unique to Buddhism, has always really bugged me.

Yes, there is pain in the world, but their is joy as well.  And the pain is not in fact constant, or even consistant over time.

The world can, and does become a better place.  There was a time, and it wasn't that long ago, when the majority of children died before reaching adulthood.  That has changed, and suffering is less because of it.

And it didn't change because people said 'oh woe is me, we are meant to suffer' it changed because some very smart, very brave and very dedicated people said 'this sucks, lets fix it.'

Will their always be sadness, pain, and suffering in the world?  Almost certainly.  But you don't 'fix it' by wanting less, you fix it by making more a reality.  And you don't fix it from hiding from the possibility of pain.

&quot;It is better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all&quot;

or

&quot;It is better to aim at the sun and miss than aim at the manure pile and hit.&quot;]]></wp:comment_content>

That is the crux of Buddhism. If you read ahead, the fourth Noble Truth is

&lt;em&gt;The path that leads out of suffering is called the Noble Eightfold Path.&lt;/em&gt;

The Eightfold Path does not include a 'oh woe is me' section. It is about movement out of suffering into love and joy.

A understanding of the problem is essential to solving it, however. If you are sick, and you do not take the time to realise that you are sick, then how can you even start to fix that sickness?

I think that the diffrence between Buddhism and most of the other philosphys out there is that Buddhism has a long track record of very scientific research into cures for suffering. They can prove that if you do X that Y will follow. If you follow the Eightfold path, you &lt;strong&gt;will&lt;/strong&gt; be happier.

If you feel compassion for others suffering, you will be very motivated to help them with their suffering. Buddhism is not about misery and pain - it just posits that you must understand the problem to fix it.]]></wp:comment_content>

Buddhism claims that.  So do many other Religions and Philosophies.

I have nothing against Buddhism, and if it works for you great.

I like the world though.  I like everything about it, even the suffering and I don't think we need a 'way out.']]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[So, you enjoy suffering? That is strange to me. Most folks do not enjoy suffering. It's unpleasant. It's painful.

Finding a way to mitigate suffering - to help yourself and others deal with it in a constructive manner still seems like a laudable goal to me.

To simply acknowledge that suffering exists, and then to attempt to look for ways to reduce it in the world seems like those &quot;very smart, very brave and very dedicated people&quot; that said &quot;this sucks, lets fix it.&quot;

The first Truth is nothing more then acknowledging that suffering exists and is universal. That means that I suffer - you suffer - everyone suffers.

As to the other philosophies and religions that make the claims of Buddhism - many do, This is true. And many work for their adherents. However, from my personal experience - the dominant religion of the West, in it's current incarnation, does not fill the need for a philosophy based on good psychology that promotes peace, Harmony and personal satisfaction.

One of the reasons that I explore Buddhism is to attempt to bring some of the psychology back into the Western Memespace. By studying it from a Westerner's perspective, I hope to release positive meme's into the wild which will help overcome some of the negativity that exists at this juncture.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Of course I don't enjoy suffering, but I celebrate the fact that suffering exists.  They are not the same thing.

Why do people climb Mt. Everest?  Because it is there.  If the highest Mountain in the world was 2 feet tall, after a gentle incline, no one would have to suffer to climb it.  And no one would bother and no one would care.  I like the fact that Everest is high.  I like the fact that mountains require suffering to climb, it gives the attempt meaning.

I don't have any bitch with the fact that suffering exists.  I certainly agree that it does.  I also don't have a huge problem with Buddhism.  I have studied it some, although admittedly at a rudimentary level and I think it does contain a lot of good ideas.

I don't know how many of those idea need to be injected into western philosophy/theology, for the most part they are already there, and I actually have found more sophistication in the Western philosophical stains than in the Eastern ones.

Now, obviously very little of that deeper philosophy enters most people's daily lives.  Most people go through the motions with their Religion and spend little time on the philosophy (or even the practice) of their Religion.  I expect that is true of Buddhist nations as well (the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/history/bstatt10.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;countries with the highest proportions of Buddhists&lt;/a&gt; certainly don't seem to be poster children for how to end suffering.

Still, I am glad you are posting this stuff.  I hope you don't take anything I write as a personal attack or a disparagement of your beliefs.  I enjoy the back and forth of this sort of discussion.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I enjoy the comments as well. Debate and Discussion help me - by making me think through my positions.

&quot;&lt;em&gt;I don't know how many of those idea need to be injected into western philosophy/theology, for the most part they are already there, and I actually have found more sophistication in the Western philosophical stains than in the Eastern ones.&lt;/em&gt;&quot;

I think that the Buddhist Psychology is more accessible to then many of it's Western counterparts. I also think that it gains a lot from having been under development for so many more years then anything out of the west. Some times complexity is not the same as sophistication. Simple, direct statement that cut to the core of the issue are more valubile to me then lofty, wordy essays.

For example;

&quot;We cannot speak Truth - we can only speak words about Truth&quot;

This statement quickly shows us the major problem with language. Language is words, which are defined by agreement. What happens when you try and communicate with some one who has a diffrent understanding of a word?

&quot;&lt;em&gt;Why do people climb Mt. Everest? Because it is there. If the highest Mountain in the world was 2 feet tall, after a gentle incline, no one would have to suffer to climb it. And no one would bother and no one would care. I like the fact that Everest is high. I like the fact that mountains require suffering to climb, it gives the attempt meaning.&lt;/em&gt;&quot;

However - if you were going to climb a mountain - would you not want to be equipped with the best tools to be had?

It's the same with life - Suffering happens. It's sad that death, pain and sickness are part of this world, but they are. So, I am going to equip my self with the best tools that I can find to deal with that suffering in a positive manners as possible. That will make me more happy. Happyness is good.

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Let me respond to the comment a few bars back...when I speak of &quot;desiring less&quot; I speak of personal denial, not deciding that we shouldn't do something about suffering.  I'm talking about &quot;Live simply so that others may simply live.&quot;  Picking a hybrid instead of a gas-guzzler.  Not wasting food.  Not wasting natural resources.  This is what I'm talking about.  Can you imagine our world as a place where people put others ahead of themselves ALL the time?  I think that's the goal I personally aim for.  I often fall short, but I also sometimes get it right.  What if we ALL got it right?]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[We can trade aphorisms all day long: &quot;John 8:32 - And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.&quot;

There are even better ones from Greek Philosophy.  &quot;When the mind's eye rests on objects illuminated by truth and reality, it understands and comprehends them, and functions intelligently; but when it turns to the twilight world of change and decay, it can only form opinions, its vision is confused and its beliefs shifting, and it seems to lack intelligence. (Plato, 380BC)&quot;

My biggest issue with Buddhists are not people like you who seem to have a genuine desire to understand that philosophy, but people who turn to Buddhism as the flavor of the week because it is exotic and eastern.  I am sure you know the type (and I have equal scorn for those who dip lightly into Christianity or Wiccan beliefs and think they are now enlightened.)

All these philosophies are complex, they are surprisingly similar and it takes more than a quick perusal to understand them.  I don't claim to have a full understanding of any of them, but perhaps enough knowledge to know how little I know.

obidavekenobi,

There is a certain nobility to that viewpoint, but their is another side as well.

It is selfishness and laziness that spawns a lot of development and creativity.  Wanting more often leads to the creation of more that is a greater benefit to mankind than any ammount of personal altruism.

Which is better for mankind, a man who gives everything he has to the poor or a man who invents a new power source?  Or even the evil capitalist who finances that power source?

Giving to others and sharing is good.  Wanting more is good too.]]></wp:comment_content>

Amorphisms aren't so bad.  They can help us be better people, if we choose to follow a good message and not just spout it like so much media hype.  I'm not worried about an appearance of nobility, I just want a better world for my kids and other future generations, that's all.  Buddhist, Catholic, Protestant...it matters not.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, Microsoft just debuted Windows <a href="http://beta.windowsonecare.com/">OneCare</a> - a product to secure their OS.</p>


<blockquote>Are you tired of spending time trying to protect and maintain your computer? Are you worried that you're still not doing everything you should to keep it safe and running at optimal performance? If your answer is "Yes," then Windows OneCareâ„¢ is for you. Windows OneCare is built specifically for people who don't have the time or technical expertise necessary to secure and manage a computer on a daily basis. It is a comprehensive PC health service that goes beyond security to take an integrated approach to help protect and care for your computer.</blockquote>

	<p>-Microsoft's <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/onecare/default.mspx">OneCare site</a></p>


	<p>Microsoft reportedly is looking at selling this as a subscription product. So - again, you pay for the OS - and you pay to keep it running? It's sort of like having to buy a car, and then pay a subscription to keep twits from slashing your tires. In some areas that would be called protection money.</p>


	<p>Getting tired of this? There are <a href="http://www.apple.com/store/">ways</a> out of the mess...</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of my beefs with the US's whole system is the stupid laws that get inacted by well meaning folks. One of my favorite is the 'no talking on cell phones while driving' law. We don't need another law about that! There is already one on the books. It's illegal to drive while you are distracted. So, if you are chattering on your cell phone, and swerving all over the place - that pretty much looks like distracted driving, right?</p>


	<p>Well, California has done it again. It's now illegal to '<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing">Phish</a>'.  Phishing is the art of stealing folk's bank account access numbers and passwords, and then robbing them blind. So, stealing was not already illegal in California? Or is this just another stupid law about something that is already covered?</p>]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[My first experience with government waste was as a DC intern watching a congressional hearing.  My prevailing thought was, &quot;Hm.  So I'm paying these guys tax dollars to read the paper, talk on a cell phone, talk to an aid, and sleep--yes, SLEEP-- during a subcommittee hearing??&quot;

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Okay, here goes...(shortest version possible):

As criminals come up with new ways of fucking the rest of us, old laws don't &quot;fit&quot; the right way.  Sure, &quot;Phishing&quot; could have fallen under &quot;Theft,&quot; but perhaps CA wanted better sentencing guidelines for this particular crime, so they codified it and narrowed it down.  &quot;Phishing&quot; might get you more points on your Criminal History and get you more time if you're caught.

In WA we've always had &quot;Assault&quot; and &quot;Theft,&quot; and a lot of Elder Abuse might fall under that, but to better prosecute the bastards who take advantage of the elderly in this state, WA narrowed it down and altered some existing statutes to better reflect the heinousness of the particular crime of ripping off/assaulting the elderly.

Okay, that was the short version.  :)]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The worst case of 'multilawness' that I have heard about is NYC - who has 16 laws that cover driving while talking on a cell phone.

I guess my issue is that it would be a lot easier to simply modify the existing statute to include a phishing addendum. It would also go a long way towards making the laws more understandable by the common man. Right now, most folks know the basics (be bad, go to jail) but if presented with specifics would not have any idea. This is because of the 'narrowing' creating a tangled morass of laws that take a specialized college degree to understand.

However, I have no illusions that this will ever happen - it would take lawmakers to grok the existing laws before bowing to political pressure and creating a narrowly targeted law which panders to a few voters.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[You didn't provide a link to anything about this actual legislation.  It occurs to me though that it has always been illegal to rob someones bank account, this new law might have a purpose in making the collection of this information illegal, regardless of whether their is proof that the information was used to rob anyone.

That would theoretically allow prosecutors to move much faster on a case such as this and prevent the actual stealing from people.]]></wp:comment_content>

<title>A look ahead for Internal Combustion Engines</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>But it is no accident that the U.S. Department of Energy and other organizations are focusing most of their research on diesel and <span class="caps">HCCI</span> engines.</blockquote>

	<p>-<a href="http://www.llnl.gov/str/Westbrook.html">Combustion Modeling</a></p>


	<p>Looks like the <span class="caps">DOE</span> and others agree with me - Diesel is the technology that we need to invest in for the short term goals.</p>


	<p>Just look at it this way - what powers the majority of our transportation system? Diesel trucks and trains. Making them even a little more efficient will garner great gains.</p>


	<p>Willy Nelson has circumstantial evidence posted that show a 40% increase in efficiency when you switch to BioDiesel (5 mpg to 7 mpg) (<a href="http://www.wnbiodiesel.com/customers.html">Willie Nelson's  Biodiesel</a>). <span class="caps">A 40</span>% increase in fuel efficiency would be a huge savings for the transportation sector.</p>


	<p>Last year, we averaged <a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/neic/quickfacts/quickoil.html">382.4 million gallons</a> of fuel a day. At the current average price of $3.00 a gallon, we are spending in the range of $1,152 milllion a day on fuel. Over 60% of that is spent by the transportation sector. So, they are spending $690 million a day on fuel. Cut that 40% and we get over $270 million a <span class="caps">DAY</span> saved. That's $98.5 billion a year in savings. We could pay for the biofuel refineries in one year, just off of the savings.</p>


	<p>Close on the horizon is the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=hcci+engine&#38;sourceid=mozilla-search&#38;start=0&#38;start=0&#38;ie=utf-8&#38;oe=utf-8&#38;client=firefox&#38;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:unofficial"><span class="caps">HCCI</span></a> engine - a next generation diesel engine that is even cleaner and more efficient then standard diesel engines.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><em>If the truth can be told so as to be understood, it will be believed.</em>

	<p>Human history represents such a radical break with the natural systems of biological organization that preceded it, that it must be the response to a kind of attractor, or dwell point that lies ahead in the temporal dimension. Persistently Western religions have integrated into their theologies the notion of a kind of end of the world, and I think that a lot of psychedelic experimentation sort of confirms this intuition, I mean, it isn't going to happen according to any of the scenarios of orthodox religion, but the basic intuition, that the universe seeks closure in a kind of omega point of transcendance, is confirmed, it's almost as though this object in hyperspace, glittering in hyperspace, throws off reflections of itself, which actually ricochet into the past, illuminating this mystic, inspiring that saint or visionary, and that out of these fragmentary glimpses of eternity we can build a kind of map, of not only the past of the universe, and the evolutionary egression into novelty, but a kind of map of the future, this is what shamanism is always been about.</p>


	<p>A shaman is someone who has been to the end, it's someone who knows how the world really works, and knowing how the world really works means to have risen outside, above, beyond the dimensions of ordinary space, time, and casuistry, and actually seen the wiring under the board, stepped outside the confines of learned culture and learned and embedded language, into the domain of what Wittgenstein called "the unspeakable", the transcendental presense of the other, which can be absanctioned, in various ways, to yield systems of knowledge which can be brought back into ordinary social space for the good of the community, so in the context of ninety percent of human culture, the shaman has been the agent of evolution, because the shaman learns the techniques to go between ordinary reality and the domain of the ideas, this higher dimensional continuum that is somehow parallel to us, available to us, and yet ordinarily occluded by cultural convention out of fear of the mystery I believe, and what shamans are, I believe, are people who have been able to de-condition themselves from the community's instinctual distrust of the mystery, and to go into it, to go into this bewildering higher dimension, and gain knowledge, recover the jewel lost at the beginning of time, to save souls, cure, commune with the ancestors and so forth and so on.</p>


	<p>Shamanism is not a religion, it's a set of techniques, and the principal technique is the use of psychedelic plants. What psychedelics do is they dissolve boundaries, and in the presence of dissolved boundaries, one cannot continue to close one's eyes to the ruination of the earth, the poisoning of the seas, and the consequences of two thousand years of unchallenged dominator culture, based on monotheism, hatred of nature, suppression of the female, and so forth and so on. So, what shamans have to do is act as exemplars, by making this cosmic journey to the domain of the Gaian ideas, and then bringing them back in the form of art to the struggle to save the world. The planet has a kind of intelligence, that it can actually open a channel of communication with an individual human being. The message that nature sends is, transform your language through a synergy between electronic culture and the psychedelic imagination, a synergy between dance and idea, a synergy between understanding and intuition, and dissolve the boundaries that your culture has sanctioned between you, to become part of this Gaian supermind, I mean I think it's fairly profound, it's fairly apocalyptic. History is ending. I mean, we are to be the generation that witnesses the revelation of the purpose of the cosmos. History is the shock wave of the eschaton. History is the shock wave of eschatology, and what this means for those of us who will live through this transition into hyperspace, is that we will be privileged to see the greatest release of compressed change probably since the birth of the universe. The twentieth century is the shudder that announces the approaching cataracts of time over which our species and the destiny of this planet is about to be swept.</p>


	<p><em>If the truth can be told so as to be understood, it will be believed.</em></p>


	<p>The emphasis in house music and rave culture on physiologically compatible rhythms and this sort of thing is really the rediscovery of the art of natural magic with sound, that sound, properly understood, especially percussive sound, can actually change neurological states, and large groups of people getting together in the presence of this kind of music are creating a telepathic community of bonding that hopefully will be strong enough that it can carry the vision out into the mainstream of society. I think that the youth culture that is emerging in the nineties is an end of the millenium culture that is actually summing up Western civilization and pointing us in an entirely different direction, that we're going to arrive in the third millenium, in the middle of an archaic revival, which will mean a revival of these physiologically empowering rhythm signatures, a new art, a new social vision, a new relationship to nature, to feminism, to ego. All of these things are taking hold, and not a moment too soon.</blockquote></p>


	<p>-<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence_McKenna">Terence McKenna</a></p>


	<p>First off, I disagree that psychedelics are necessary, or even a good path. I think that the same results can be obtained with deep meditation and the search for enlightenment. Honestly, I feel that the results from a mediative study are easier to reproduce, and more 'accurate' then those obtained though the use of mind altering drugs and plants. In no way, take this as a validation of using drugs. Ok, that's out of the way! :)</p>


	<p>I was first introduced to this philosophy when I was listening to the Boss Drum by the Shamen about 12 or 15 years ago.  It really resonated with me on several levels.</p>


	<p>I just wanted to post it - because I find it fascinating.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hey, that's Terence McKenna, the great mushroom shaman who passed away some time ago. I've heard his audio tapes; for somebody discussing some of the strange concepts he talks about, he sounds really normal. And a nice guy.

It's all fascinating stuff. The human mind is capable of so much, of course we're going to wonder what more is in there, or what more is out there for us to discover with greater opened minds.

Here's looking forward to further insights.]]></wp:comment_content>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So - last week we talked about Suffering, and how it is universal. Like it or not, everyone will feel some suffering some time in their life. Suffering is the first of the Four Noble Truths that the Buddha talked about during his first sermon after reaching enlightenment.</p>


	<p>1. Dukkha: There is suffering. Suffering is an intrinsic part of life also experienced as dissatisfaction, discontent, unhappiness, impermanence.
2. Samudaya: There is a cause of suffering, which is attachment and desire (tanha).
3. Nirodha: There is a way out of suffering, which is to eliminate attachment and desire.
4. Magga: The path that leads out of suffering is called the Noble Eightfold Path.</p>


	<p>Having the stage set, this week we explore Why? Why is suffering universal? What causes it? Now that we know that the sickness exists, what is it's cause?</p>


<blockquote>The clinging to desire comes from our experience that short-term satisfaction comes from following desire. We ignore the fact that satisfying our desires doesn't bring an end to them.</blockquote>

	<p>I think that those questions can be summed up as Attachment and Desire. We become unhappy when things in the illusory external universe, things which are impermanent, fail us. When we invest ourselves into a relationship, and the other person cheats, lies, or just up and leaves, we become unhappy. When we are attached to our physical possessions, and they are stolen or lost in a flood, we become hurt.</p>


<blockquote>there is an origin of suffering and that the origin of suffering is attachment to the three kinds of desire: desire for sense pleasure (kama tanha), desire to become (bhava tanha) and desire to get rid of (vibhava tanha). This is the statement of the Second Noble Truth, the thesis, the pariyatti</blockquote>

	<p>This is the point where Buddhist philosophy and psychology leaves most people behind. They think that the 4th truth is about severing all ties to everything. Being a buddhist in the real world is <strong>not</strong> about being a cold or uncaring person.  It is <strong>not</strong> about being unconnected from everything.</p>


<blockquote>In emptiness, things are just what they are. When we are aware in this way, it doesn't mean that we are indifferent to success or failure and that we don't bother to do anything. We can apply ourselves. We know what we can do; we know what has to be done and we can do it in the right way. Then everything becomes Dhamma, the way it is. We do things because that is the right thing to be doing at this time and in this place rather than out of a sense of personal ambition or fear of failure.</blockquote>

	<p>-<a href="http://www.buddhanet.net/4noble.htm">The Four Noble Truths</a></p>


	<p>When you exist in the now, and you have no delusions about the outside universe, you can make your choices from a much more informed point then if you are trying to unravel everything about you. For example, if you were talking to a person, and you were trying to figure out what they were thinking about you, about what you were saying you probably would act a certain way. Would that person be <strong>you</strong>?</p>


	<p>We interact with a world that does not exist. We make large portions of it up in our minds, and then become confused when things do not work exactly like we want them to. We assign feelings to people that might or might not have them, and then act as if they did.</p>


	<p>Buddhism is about penetrating that veil of illusion and seeing the world as it really it. In my mind, enlightenment means <em>seeing clearly</em>. Buddhism is more then just a religion, more then just a philosophy. It's a psychology, a way of learning to live in harmony with the real world. It is very pragmatic. In Buddhism, you are instructed to think for your self - to investigate and learn. Nothing should be taken on faith.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Have you ever read &lt;i&gt;Hardcore Zen&lt;/i&gt; by Brad Warner? It is not the most in depth of Zen texts...in fact it is more of a contemporary (everyday) approach to Zen...but I think it one of the better books on capturing the essence of Buddhism.

Anyway, there's something about your writing that totally reminds me of that book. Personally, I think that's a good comparison, but you may disagree...]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I know a LOT of people who follow the notion of obsessing about what the person they're talking with might be thinking of them at that moment.  It makes them VERY unhappy and it ruins communication.  It blows people away when I say, &quot;I don't give a shit what that person thinks of me.  I'm going to say what I think and not worry about their personal point-of-view of me.  I have to live with myself, not them.&quot;  This doesn't give me license to be an asshole, but it sure does give me peace-of-mind.  My friends are truly my friends, with no pretenses.

Tsykoduk can attest to this.  ;)  Both his wife and mine have been on the opposite end of, &quot;Okay, dear, here's how it is in the real world...&quot;]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[&quot;For example, if you were talking to a person, and you were trying to figure out what they were thinking about you, about what you were saying you probably would act a certain way. Would that person be you?&quot;

There is obviously a balance that needs to be struck here.  If you pay no attention to how a person is recieving your communication, they will probably not get it.  There is an aphorism &quot;No one cares how much you know until they know how much you care&quot; that I think is instructive here.  Communication has a purpose, and focusing solely on the one side of it, what you are saying is a soliloqy.

It is also my belief that we become, in part, that which we try to be.  When you ask 'would that person be you?' the answer is probably yes, eventually.  We become a kind person by trying to always be kind, even if we are naturally selfish bastards.  I don't think you can seperate the person from the mask they choose to wear, making the choice to wear a mask is part of the person.

Interacting with a world that doesn't exist is necessary, and I think good.  A huge portion of our lives is indeed an internal construct.  Without that construct though, their is no possiblity for imagination, hope, dreams or love.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[&lt;em&gt;Chimmy&lt;/em&gt;: I think that I am going to get that book. It sounds interesting

&lt;em&gt;ObiDave&lt;/em&gt;: I am going to follow your lead - brutal honesty follows. There is a big difference between being honest and compassionate and what I have witnessed you do to my wife. I did not agree with your methodology, nor your tone.

Being honest does not mean tearing down. Being honest to yourself when you are communicating with others means that you are presenting yourself, not some front to try and please them. Compassionate honesty means that you are honest, and loving in your approach. You are not aggressive nor attacking.

With my wife - you were aggressive and attacking. I was so concerned about the tone, I almost deleted the email before she read it.

&lt;em&gt;Justus&lt;/em&gt;: You must interact with it - however by understanding that it is a construct of your own making, you can learn to deal with it better.

Also - we cannot do it all at once. I am only looking at one side of it right now - the side that I can control. As I learn to deal with that which I can control, I can learn to deal with the other side of the coin.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[&quot;In Buddhism, you are instructed to think for your self , to investigate and learn.&quot;

Is this why we did not get a homework assignment this week?  :)

As far as honesty goes, I am also of the school where I don't really care what people think of my opinions, views, etc...

I do, however, try to practice some restraint when it comes to the feelings of others.

Example, my wife often rolls her eyes at what I might choose to wear at times, and I basically tell her that I am not dressing to impress anyone. I literally don't what you might think if you see what I choose to wear if I am doing yardwork and then have to run to Home Depot. I don't go get all prettied up, I just go!

The same attitude holds true when writing on my website.

I don't write to placate others, I write to express what I am thinking at any given time, right or wrong.  I do not purposely try to offend, or attack others directly, although much of what I say can make weaker minded people uncomfortable at times I'm sure.  I just enjoy good discussions on topics that at times can be emmotional.

Being honest to the point of being cruel is not a good trait to have.  There are times when what your mother told you holds true, and that is, &quot;If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all.&quot;

Being honest is good, being stupid is not.  If you have issue with someone, you will be a better person for holding your tounge, rather then use honesty as a cruch for being mean.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Okay, I gotta' chime-in on thisâ€¦I'll post both on Tsykoduk and Whitecaps' blogs.

The 'felonyâ€ described in this post is not a felony in Washington; it's a misdemeanor.  'Vehicle Prowling in the Second Degree.â€

Any building being entered is automatically a felony whether it is 1st or 2nd Degree Burglary, or Residential Burglary.

Spokane Police Officers (line guys, like me) have always been disgusted by the amount of false alarms to which we are REQUIRED BY POLICY to respond.  It is a phenomenal waste of our dwindling resources that are paid for by the citizens (again, like me).  In my 12-year-career I have been to ONE good in-progress alarm.  The rest have been false, or we were too late (resources, again) to do anything about it besides take a report and try to track the bad guys down later.

Something that always needs to be considered when police are unable to respond in a timely manner is this: how many officers did we have on duty at that time, and to what other priorities were those officers responding?  There are days that we can't respond to Vehicle Prowling in progress, and there are days we can respond to noise complaintsâ€¦it all depends on calls for service and staffing.  You cannot expect any agency to be able to do more with less, despite what the politicians say is possible.

It is absolutely accurate to state that the false alarm stuff basically boils-down to a lobby by alarm companies.  Again, we line guys are disgusted that policing in this country is led by liability and justice goes only to those who can afford itâ€¦

â€¦but please be careful when condemning 'the police.â€  90% of the people I work with are good people who work hard and do what's right.  Please also remember that it is not we guys in the trenches who set policy; that's up to our Chiefs, and we have little or nothing to say about it.

As a side note, I agree with much of what was posted in Whitecaps' previous article about DV.  The law should be applied to all people, regardless of occupation (etc), or it means nothing.  I feel badly for the Deputy who was arrested, worse for the victim of his offense, and also feel the whole ordeal myself because (as the articles and public outcry prove) it puts a black eye on the rest of us who wear our badge with honor.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I do know you better than that, Tsyko...I guess I got my dander up.  SPD is taking a LOT of hits in the media, lately.  It's killing me because I know what's being broadcast ain't how things really are, it's how pissed-off people are perceiving them.  Because of my conditions of employment I'm only allowed to say so much about it.  I (and many of my co-workers) feel betrayed by our Admin and the City for not telling the public how bad it is, and how much worse it's about to become in 2006.

Now here's my opinion on the guy confronting the car prowler: shouldn't have done it.  What is more important, his life or his property?  I've been burglarized, and had my truck prowled, and been assaulted (a lot).  I know what it's like to be a victim of crime, so I don't speak out of turn when I say to people, &quot;Call 911, and let the guy steal your stereo if you have to.  You can always replace a thing, but you can't replace yourself.&quot;

I think if more people adopted the ways of your other thread (that I am greatly enjoying) they wouldn't worry so much about car stereos!  ;)  Love you, man.]]></wp:comment_content>

<p>Like General McClellan, you're smart enough to know what tactical decisions to make. However, the problem with McClellan is that he could never sprout the balls to act on his information, and in the end, that's why Geoge McClellan is only a sidenote in the history books. </p>
<p>After graduating from West Point, he served with distinction in the Mexican War and later worked on various engineering projects, notably on the survey (1853-54) for a Northern Pacific RR route across the Cascade Range. Resigning from the army in 1857, he was a railroad official until the outbreak of the Civil War. In May, 1861, McClellan was made commander of the Dept. of the Ohio and a major general in the regular army. He cleared the western part of Virginia of Confederates (June-July, 1861) and consequently, after the Union defeat in the first battle of Bull Run, was given command of the troops in and around Washington. In November he became general in chief. The administration, reflecting public opinion, pressed for an early offensive, but McClellan insisted on adequate training and equipment for his army. In Mar., 1862, he was relieved of his supreme command, but he retained command of the Army of the Potomac, with which in Apr., 1862, he initiated the Peninsular campaign . The collapse of this campaign after the Seven Days battles was charged by many to his overcaution. In Aug. 1862, most of McClellan's troops were reassigned to the Army of Virginia under John Pope . After Pope's defeat at the second battle of Bull Run, McClellan again reorganized the Union forces, and in the Antietam campaign he checked Robert E. Lee's first invasion of the North. He was slow, however, to follow Lee across the Potomac and in Nov., 1862, was removed from his command. </p></td> </tr> <tr> <td align="center"> <img src="http://is0.okcupid.com/users/708/870/7088714327834954884/mt1117655343.jpg"/> </td> </tr> </tbody></table> <br /><br /><br /> <table cellpadding="20"> <tbody><tr> <td> <span id="comparisonarea">My test tracked 4 variables How you compared to other people <i>your age and gender</i>:<blockquote><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="4"><tbody><tr><td valign="middle"><table bgcolor="black" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="1"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#b2cfff" height="20" width="12"><a href="http://www.okcupid.com"><img src="http://is3.okcupid.com/graphics/0.gif" alt="free online dating" border="0"/></a></td><td bgcolor="white" width="138"><a href="http://www.okcupid.com"><img src="http://is3.okcupid.com/graphics/0.gif" alt="free online dating" border="0"/></a></td></tr></tbody></table></td><td valign="middle">You scored higher than <b>8%</b> on <b>Unorthodox</b></td></tr><tr><td valign="middle"><table bgcolor="black" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="1"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#b2cfff" height="20" width="149"><a href="http://www.okcupid.com"><img src="http://is3.okcupid.com/graphics/0.gif" alt="free online dating" border="0"/></a></td><td bgcolor="white" width="1"><a href="http://www.okcupid.com"><img src="http://is3.okcupid.com/graphics/0.gif" alt="free online dating" border="0"/></a></td></tr></tbody></table></td><td valign="middle">You scored higher than <b>99%</b> on <b>Tactics</b></td></tr><tr><td valign="middle"><table bgcolor="black" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="1"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#b2cfff" height="20" width="9"><a href="http://www.okcupid.com"><img src="http://is3.okcupid.com/graphics/0.gif" alt="free online dating" border="0"/></a></td><td bgcolor="white" width="141"><a href="http://www.okcupid.com"><img src="http://is3.okcupid.com/graphics/0.gif" alt="free online dating" border="0"/></a></td></tr></tbody></table></td><td valign="middle">You scored higher than <b>6%</b> on <b>Guts</b></td></tr><tr><td valign="middle"><table bgcolor="black" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="1"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#b2cfff" height="20" width="18"><a href="http://www.okcupid.com"><img src="http://is3.okcupid.com/graphics/0.gif" alt="free online dating" border="0"/></a></td><td bgcolor="white" width="132"><a href="http://www.okcupid.com"><img src="http://is3.okcupid.com/graphics/0.gif" alt="free online dating" border="0"/></a></td></tr></tbody></table></td><td valign="middle">You scored higher than <b>12%</b> on <b>Ruthlessness</b></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote></span> </td> </tr> </tbody></table> <table cellpadding=20><tr><td>Link: <a href='http://www.okcupid.com/tests/take?testid=13827291814577368116'>The Which Historic General Are You Test</a> written by <a href='http://www.okcupid.com/profile?tuid=7088714327834954884'>dasnyds</a> on <a href='http://www.okcupid.com'>Ok Cupid</a>, home of the <a href='http://www.okcupid.com/oktest3'>32-Type Dating Test</a></td></tr></table>

<title>Week 4: The 4th Noble Truth</title>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I took a week off - there was a wedding that I was a videographer for, and several other pressing concerns that I could not shake.</p>


	<p>Anyways - on to the Fourth Noble Truth: The Eight-fold Path.</p>


	<p>In summary, the Eight Fold path is:</p>


<blockquote>1. Wisdom (panna)

	<p>Right Understanding (samma ditthi)
Right Aspiration (samma sankappa)</p>


	<p>2. Morality (sila)</p>


	<p>Right Speech (samma vaca)
Right Action (samma kammanta)
Right Livelihood (samma ajiva)</p>


	<p>3. Concentration (samadhi)</p>


	<p>Right Effort (samma vayama)
Right Mindfulness (samma sati)
Right Concentration (samma samadhi)</blockquote></p>


	<p>- <a href="http://www.buddhanet.net/4noble.htm">The Four Noble Truths</a></p>


	<p>As we spoke about <a href="https://greg.nokes.name/2005/10/09/buddhism-week-2-suffering-and-the-path/">last time</a>, suffering and pain is a very real part of the world that we find ourselves in. By understanding that desire and wanting is the root of all suffering, we can start to elevate ourselves above it. We are still part of the world. However we see, and act differently when we understand that everything suffers, that everything is impermeant, and that desire fuels our suffering.</p>


	<p>When we put our desire on something - be it physical (I want this new car), spiritual (I want to be a better person) or personal (I hope s/he loves me) we attach energy to that object. When that object is not as we wish it, or when it fails us (as everything will, due to nothing being permeant) we feel suffering due to the loss of that energy. We give it power over our feelings and our lives.</p>


	<p>One way to conceptualize this, is that everything; feelings, physical objects, interpersonal relationships, exist in a sort of hyper-space. This Hyper-space exists out side our universe, but in our timestream. It intersects with our space in that these objects in Hyper-space 'exist' in our space. We can attach ourselves to these 'hyper-space objects' with filaments of our being, if we so choose.</p>


	<p>When these objects try and follow their destiny and we are attached, one of two things happen - either the line snaps, or we engage in a struggle, trying to pull the object back to us. One way is fast, hard pain and the other is long drawn out suffering.</p>


	<p>Making a choice to be unconnected from these 'hyper-space objects' we do not have to suffer when they change or leave.</p>


	<p>Please note, being unconnected does not mean that we are ascetics. It does not mean that we are indifferent about our fellow life forms suffering. Instead, it means that we follow the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Way">Middle Way</a>. We are engaged in the world, but we also see it for what it really is. We do not self-indulge too much, neither do we practice self-mortification. We follow the Middle Way. We walk the path between the cliffs and the mountains.</p>


	<p>How does this tie into the Eight Fold Path? The path <em>is</em> the way. It <strong>is</strong> the path between the cliffs and the mountains. It teaches us how to live in harmony with the universe, and how to really see. It's not a path of eight steps however. You do not graduate from step one to step two. Each step is to be practiced with each of your breaths, as well as you can.</p>


	<p>Of course, we cannot do everything all at once - so I suggest breaking it into smaller chunks. When meditating, practice samma samadhi. When talking practice samma vaca.</p>


	<p>I want to leave you this week with one thought from the Buddha:</p>


<blockquote>On one occasion, while Venerable Sariputta was sitting, listening respectfully at his feet as the Buddha expounded the Dhamma, the Buddha turned to him and asked,

	<p>"Sariputta, do you believe this teaching?"</p>


	<p>Venerable Sariputta replied, "No, I don't yet believe it."</p>


	<p>Now this is a good illustration. Venerable Sariputta listened, and he took note. When he said he didn't yet believe he wasn't being careless, he was speaking the truth. He simply took note of that teaching, because he had not yet developed his own understanding of it, so he told the Buddha that he didn't yet believe-because he really didn't believe. These words almost sound as if Venerable Sariputta was being rude, but actually he wasn't. He spoke the truth, and the Buddha praised him for it.</p>


	<p>"Good, good, Sariputta. A wise person doesn't readily believe, he should consider first before believing." </blockquote></p>


	<p>-<a href="http://www.saigon.com/~anson/ebud/ebmed090.htm">Venerable Ajahn Chah</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I'm surprised no one has commented on this post.  I have read it several times so that I could mull it over a bit.  I really like what it says, and I appreciate the Wikipedia link.  In a way I am proud to say that some of this I try daily to incorporate into my own life.  The more specific part would be the notion that by attaching energy (&quot;chi&quot; or whatever you would like to call it) to something gives it power over you.  I have worked very hard to break a lot of the chains of things in life that have held sway over me.  It is HUGELY liberating to practice &quot;The Middle Way&quot; and not worry so much.  I hope you do well with this, too, Tsykoduk.  Freedom is a wonderful thing.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Thanks for the kind words!

One of the cool things about Buddhism is that it puts into words what some of us just know. It's all really common sense, You can see threads of this thought process in almost every religion. I guess that I like buddhism because it just seems to make sense to me. :)]]></wp:comment_content>

<title>Biodiesel coming to Spokane?</title>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote> A prominent state lawmaker is calling for construction of a biodiesel fuel refinery in Eastern Washington, fed by local crops and paid for partly with millions of dollars in state money.

	<p>"There's benefit for everybody if we get this thing going," said Rep. Hans Dunshee, D-Snohomish, who chairs the House construction- budget committee. So far, he said, groups in Lincoln County, Columbia County and Spokane Valley are interested. The Spokane-area proposal comes from several local farm cooperatives and the county conservation district.</blockquote></p>


	<p>-<a href="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4186/is_20050929/ai_n15649732#continue">Spokesman Review</a></p>


	<p>This sounds like an excellent idea. To be able to produce our own fuel, locally, and with out extensive harm to the enviroment is a great thing. Spokane currently uses about 10,000 gallons of <span class="caps">B20</span> blend a month. It is shipped into town from plants back east.</p>


	<p>If we could localize the production of this resource, and start to offer it at more and more retail outlets, the Diesel community would embrace it. Especially since it <em>should</em> be cheaper then Dino-Diesel once we have the production up and running here.</p>


	<p>I think the solutions will lay in the details. If we can get a refinery and mash plant constructed and operational here, that will cut the prices of Biofuel. If the State would cut taxes on it (as it is better on the enviroment and will help with the Federal Clean Air act responsiblities), it would be a win/win scenerio.</p>


	<p>With the call for a <a href="http://spokanelightrail.com/spokanelightrail/">Light Rail</a> system in Spokane, and with many of the trains running on Diesel - <span class="caps">B100</span> would be a perfect fuel. Personally, I would not support any light rail system that was not <span class="caps">B100</span> powered, or at least as clean in totality. Electric might not be the awnser either - where is that power generated, and using what methods?</p>


	<p>Much of the energy producted in the Spokane area is hydropower. Hydropower is a good solution, however there is a significant portion that is produced by Gas powerplants. With the current spike in natural gas prices, we can see why we might want to look towards local, clean, power production.</p>


	<p>Honestly (and I know that I am not going to win any awards for thinking this), I would support a new Nuclear power plant in Eastern Washington. Nuke Plants are not what they used to be.</p>


<blockquote>One of the major requirements for sustaining human progress is an adequate source of energy. The current largest sources of energy are the combustion of coal, oil and natural gas ... They will last quite a while but will probably run out or become harmful in tens to hundreds of years. Solar energy will also work but is not much developed yet except for special applications because of its high cost. This high cost as a main source, e.g. for central station electricity, is likely to continue, and nuclear energy is likely to remain cheaper. A major advantage of nuclear energy (and also of solar energy) is that it doesn't put carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere. How much of an advantage depends on how bad the <span class="caps">CO2</span> problem turns out to be.</blockquote>

	<p>-<a href="http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/progress/nuclear-faq.html">John McCarthy</a></p>


	<p>If we as a species are to survive for the long term, we need to start thinking in the long term. We <strong>must</strong> find ways to sustain ourselves, and not impact the environment too greatly. Our current use of dirty fossil fuels has got to stop.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[It is hard for me to rationalize a need for government money in this project.  If it is economically viable, the private sector should be willing and able to do it, if it isn't then I certainly don't want the state wasting its money on it.

Now, state policies can properly make this a more attractive venture.  Pollution should be taxed, and to the extent that bio-diesel is cleaner it should be taxed less (which would provide economic incentive to use it.)  The state can also help by making sure that environmental regulations governing the construction and operation of a refining plant are sensible.

I remain skeptical that bio-Diesel is actually able to compete economically with fossil fuels, although the $60 a barrel number for oil is probably in the neighborhood.  Of course with the amount of petro chemicals that go into farming, higher oil prices may make bio fuel less competitive rather than more competitive.

I also worry that bio-diesel might appear competitive because of ag-subsidies when it is actually not, creating a pretty nasty economic situation.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[&quot;&lt;i&gt;For a biodiesel facility with a crusher to break even financially, he says, it must sell the meal left after crushing for about $400 to $500 a ton. That byproduct revenue pushes the cost of producing biodiesel oil below $1 a gallon and makes it competitive with petroleum prices, after distribution costs. Although canola meal is valued at only between $150 and $175 a ton, edible mustard meal sells from $800 to $1,000 a ton&lt;/i&gt;&quot;

--&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spokanejournal.com/spokane_id=article&amp;amp;sub=2499&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Spokane Journal of Business&lt;/a&gt;

We as a country spend billions of tax dollars on energy right now (23 billion in '05 according to the GPO). Why not take some of that money and use it to make us more energy independent?

If the mash spoken about above sells for $800 a ton (that's $.40 a pound, and it can be used as a really good organic fertilizer - which sells for more then $2 a pound - there's profit there as well) then the price to produce a gallon of biodiesel will be under a dollar to produce.

Add 50% mark up, and you have diesel for half the price that it's selling right now.

The plant will be able to make about 5 million gallons of fuel a year - so that's 2.5 million in profits a year.

All of the profit numbers are WAGs, but you get the idea. It is do-able. We already sink tens of billions a year into energy. Let's put some of that to good use and get a renewable, clean fuel source.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The billions of dollars on energy isn't a result of needs or economics, it is a result of pork barrel spending.  I don't see any reason to believe that the money will move from a poorly designed project to this one, even if this is a good project.

The very fact that it seems to require government money to be viable seems to argue against it.  If is would be as profitable as you say, why arn't there tons of investors lining up?]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I agree that it's pork. However, if we are going to have pork, why not make it tasty?

I am all for cutting the waste out of goverment - and cutting taxes to increase the GDP. However, I am a realist. The Republican party does not want small goverment. It wants power. It gets power through a larger goverment that is more intrusive. Same with the Democrats. The Democrats are at least open about it.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I agree with that.  The point I make is that pork doesn't often move from one place to another.  Usually, it stays where it is, and new pork is added to the existing pork.

Spokane's bio-diesel won't come at the expense to the 'bridge to nowhere' it will be in addition to the 'bridge to nowhere' and everything else.

While there will doubtless me more pork whether we have bio-diesel in Spokane, I certainly will not be a part of encouraging it.

Also, anything that needs pork like this seems to me to be likely to be a bad idea.  If it was a good idea fundamentally, it wouldn't need the pork.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[So you are saying the goverment is just a fat pig?

I think that it will happen - I would just rather see it sooner then later. If some goverment incentives can make it happen that much sooner, then by all means.

I would rather see a tax cut for bio-fuels and bio-fuel plants. I think that makes more sense then some pork products being slopped into the Spokane Valley. However, being a realist, I think that the likelyhood of a tax cut from this administration is about as likely as finding a penny on the moon.]]></wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>More than a billion dollars a day, $45 million an hour, almost $340 for every living American â€” that's what Exxon Mobil reported in third-quarter revenue Thursday.

	<p>For the oil giant, that translated to $9.9 billion in net income.</blockquote></p>


	<p>-<a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstecinexpensive.hnology/2002588325_oilearns28.html">Seattle Times</a></p>


	<p>They must have made so much money because Oil prices were so high, they just had to raise the prices of their gas.</p>


	<p>Now, I do not begrudge them these high profits. We are in a sellers market when it comes to fuel - there are limited ways to get it, and we all need it. That is why we must start to depend on fossil fuels less, and start to invest in ways to make ourselves independent of other countries and oil conglomerates whims.</p>


	<p>I hope that the last years events have shown that, when we can, energy production should be as close to the energy users as possible, clean and inexpensive. We can do this, we just need to make it happen. They Spokane biofuels plant that is being planned is a good start. Nuclear power stations through out the country are another good start.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<title>Week 5: The Eightfold Path</title>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>1. Wisdom (panna)
Right Understanding (samma ditthi)
Right Aspiration (samma sankappa)
</blockquote><br />

	<p>The first step on the Eightfold path is about understanding and knowledge. After all, if we do not know, we cannot do.</p>


<blockquote>Right view is the beginning and the end of the path, it simply means to see and to understand things as they really are and to realize the Four Noble Truth. As such, right view is the cognitive aspect of wisdom. It means to see things through, to grasp the impermanent and imperfect nature of worldly objects and ideas, and to understand the law of karma and karmic conditioning. Right view is not necessarily an intellectual capacity, just as wisdom is not just a matter of intelligence. Instead, right view is attained, sustained, and enhanced through all capacities of mind. It begins with the intuitive insight that all beings are subject to suffering and it ends with complete understanding of the true nature of all things. Since our view of the world forms our thoughts and our actions, right view yields right thoughts and right actions.</blockquote>

	<p>-<a href="http://www.thebigview.com/buddhism/index.html">The Big View</a></p>


	<p>Only through seeing things as they really are, can we start on the path. Only by traveling the path, can we see things as they really are. Basically, if you think everyone is out to get you, then you will act furtively, and people will not trust you. Self fulfilling prophesy. By penetrating the veil of illusion, by seeing through the emotion and seeing what is really happening we can act appropriately. If our vision is clouded by emotion, we will see phantoms and act from fear and confusion.</p>


	<p>We must move beyond simple understanding. We can intellectually understand that we have to see things correctly to proceed. We have to move beyond simple intellect however. To barrow a word, we have to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grok">grok</a> right understanding. We have to <em>be</em> right understanding. It's a tall order, and most of us will not reach it all of the time. We can strive for it, and in the striving we become better people. How do we strive?</p>


<blockquote>While right view refers to the cognitive aspect of wisdom, right intention refers to the volitional aspect, i.e. the kind of mental energy that controls our actions. Right intention can be described best as commitment to ethical and mental self-improvement. Buddha distinguishes three types of right intentions: 1. the intention of renunciation, which means resistance to the pull of desire, 2. the intention of good will, meaning resistance to feelings of anger and aversion, and 3. the intention of harmlessness, meaning not to think or act cruelly, violently, or aggressively, and to develop compassion.</blockquote>

	<p>-<a href="http://www.thebigview.com/buddhism/index.html">The Big View</a></p>


	<p>Part of understanding right sight is practicing it. This step on the path asks us to practice what we learn as we learn it, enabling us to learn more. By practiceing good intentions, we can learn how to see correctly, and by seeing correctly we can learn how to practice right aspiration.</p>


	<p>This is follows the law of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma#Buddhism">Karma</a>: You reap what you sow. If you are a negative person, and treat others badly you will not find much happiness in the world. However if you are a positive person, then you will find that life seems easier.</p>


	<p>By practicing Right Aspiration we start our selves down the road towards being more positive people. We start down the road towards peace and happiness.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[:)

I believe very firmly in the psychological explanations for Karma in the here and now. It's a verifiable fact that people with positive outlooks, who treat others with compassion and love are more at peace and happier then those who act out of anger, aggression and malice.

As far as a universal constant, I really do not know. I see how it could be part of the universe, however I personally do  not have any evidence of it's action. I try and stay away from 'spooky actions at a distance', however they do have a place in modern physics. Take for example the duality of photons as particles and waves. How does a photon's know what we are looking for, and present the correct view?

Personally, I believe that there is a lot that we do not understand about the universe. Neither Science nor Religion nor Philosophy alone will give us all of the answers. Buddhism tries to bridge that gap - by giving us a philosophy and religion based on observation, provable facts. And, if that were not enough, it tells you just about at every turn to process it, think on it, and make up your own mind.

So, I feel that the jury is out on a universal law of Karma. Also on reincarnation. I tend to be a realist.]]></wp:comment_content>

It is up to us to be good, and to spread good. :)]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Whether you believe in God or not, it is pretty clear that we don't have the same talents and the same challenges.

It might be easy for you to 'know good' while very tough for me.  While that concept can lead to becoming a crutch, where we blame all our failing on things outside of our control, the reverse has dangers as well, where we judge another for being weak where we are strong and lack compassion.

So I would say, heaven or genetics or good luck and good friends or whatever help us to know the good.  And help us also to not judge to harshly those who do not.  We can never truly walk in anothers shoes or know the challenges they face.  Most people do the best with what they have.  If some fail more than others, let us be thankful for lesser challenges not contemptuous.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Looks like I need to elaborate...

&quot;Heaven help us&quot; is, in this case, just a colloquialism, not an invokation, though I do profess a faith in the Christian God.  This faith provides me with something I often have none of: hope.  Human &quot;understanding&quot; be damned; &quot;Logic, logic, logic.  Logic is the beginning of wisdom, Valeris.  Not the end.&quot; -Captain Spock, ST VI: The Undiscovered Country

Socrates meant this: if a person has a true understanding of &quot;the good,&quot; and they truly know and understand that &quot;the good&quot; is good for all (including themselves) then they will do the good automatically.  Those who do not do the good do not truly know the good, because knowing is more than a mental ascent and an intellectual nod; it is action.  Anything else is pretending.  Forgive that this is a one paragraph summation of a semester of Philosophy 101.

As Paul might say, works follow faith, not the other way around (like the Mormons and some other folks believe).

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Dave;

I would propose that with or with out the crutch of a higher power, the choice to know good is just that - a choice. Each of us can make it. We might be limited in the level of goodness that we can reach, however we can strive to be the best that we can.

Part of the 4 Noble Truths is &quot;&lt;em&gt;Realizing that suffering exists is the first step in obtaining happiness. Understanding it is the first step towards real compassion. When we see and understand that Suffering is the common human bond, we can start to feel real compassion. It's sad, but I think that unhappiness is the primary motivator for most people out there. Their actions are trying to fill a void.&lt;/em&gt;&quot;

You could say that to not know goodness is to suffer. When some one sees suffering in another, they should be compassionate and do what they can to help.

Obi;

I do not need the hope of some third party coming down to save me. I have the hope of reaching satori, and knowing that I did it on my own. I guess that is the difference between what I believe and Monotheism. I do not think that I need saving.  I am not encumbered by Sin that I did not personally commit.

I also disagree about faith and works. Works and Faith are not connected. Works (bringing compassion and love into the world) are not dependent upon some faith (belief in something that cannot be proven). Faithless people have done great things in the world.

When we invoke Heaven, Hell, God - we are setting a thought scape. Like it or not, Heaven is associated with Christian Faith in this country. By using those charged works, we bring religion (espc. Christianity) into the discussion.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Buddhism &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%3D%3D&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;==&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_religions&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;religion &lt;/a&gt;however.

As to what choices we have, the Buddhist understating of Karma is based on Intent. &quot;&lt;em&gt;Karma is one of the most important concepts in Buddhism. Karma is an imprint in one's Mind. When one performs a good deed out of good intentions, the good intentions come from the Mind. Having done that good deed, the residues of these intentions stay in one's Mind as &quot;imprints&quot;, and that is &quot;good karma&quot;. The opposite goes for evil deeds (or what the Buddha would call &quot;unwholesome deeds&quot;) done out of greed, hatred etc.&lt;/em&gt;&quot; -- &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.serve.com/cmtan/buddhism/karma.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;About Karma&lt;/a&gt;

So - I would say that our choices may be limited, but our intent is not. If we are trying to be 'good', but due to some handycap we cannot be, the intent is enough to help provide us with good Karma.

When we have enough good Karma, we can make the choices that lead to liberating Karma. Then we can  reach &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satori&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Satori&lt;/a&gt;]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The nice thing about most of the various religions in the world is that they focus on doing good.  Sure they all go about it in different ways, but the end result is that Christians, Buddhists, Wiccans, Mormons, all want to do good deeds.

Karma seems to merely be the psychological effects of the deeds you perform.  Whether Karma is good or bad is irrelevant.  Karma is just a term to explain what we all already know.  If you do good, you feel good, if you are bad, life seems to not be as happy for you then.  Call it Karma, call it psychology, call it being a good Christian or a good Buddhist.  The nice thing is that in the end, we're all wanting basically the same thing.

This is exactly why religion doesn't do much for me.  It often seems like a bunch of folks all arguing about the exact same things, but wanting their approach to be the only way.  It's back to the gang mentality.  The gang you're in is better then the gang that others are in.  You're right, they're wrong.  Yet, it's all just the same.

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Tsykoduk, you have a way of pushing buttons, but at least it encourages thoughtful discussion.

A choice to believe in a &quot;higher power&quot; and to have faith and a specific religion does not mean that a person is using a &quot;crutch.&quot;  It does not mean that they cannot think for themselves, or discover truth on their own.  Religion and faith can be a roadmap in a confusing and painful world (a world of suffering, and the Buddhists correctly point out).

I do not necessarily believe I pay for the sins of my forebears, but I certainly believe I have done enough naughty on my own to merit some concern!  ;)

We have to be careful when we discuss &quot;intent.&quot;  Get past the reference when I say, &quot;The road to hell is paved with good intentions.&quot;  Hitler thought his intent was pure.  Koresh thought his intent was pure.  Bin Laden thinks his intent is pure.  Intent is not a good litmus test of doing the good.

Faith and works can be connected, but aren't always so.  Some people are genuinely  concerned enough for their fellow human being to do good for them without a faith-based system guiding them, but as Mystic pointed-out most religions focus on doing good.  And again Mystic is correct in asserting that most of us all want the same thing in the end.  For my part it's peace and understanding.  I believe I can gain a lot of that by studying many religions and many schools of philosophical thought and by using logic, but in the end I still choose a particular flavor of religion and faith to use as my roadmap in life.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[&lt;em&gt;Hitler thought his intent was pure. Koresh thought his intent was pure. Bin Laden thinks his intent is pure. Intent is not a good litmus test of doing the good.&lt;/em&gt;

Can I just say, 'Huh?â€  ;)

If you're intent is to wipe out others, that is certainly a litmus test of your intent to perform evil.  Just because someone has any intent, does not make their intent good.  A purely evil intent is still pure certainly, but not good.

What I think Tsykoduk is saying is something like this.  If, for example, you build a damn to provide a source of energy for a city, yet the damn breaks and wipes out that very same city, the intent was to do good, but things didn't turn out the way they should have.  The intent was good, the outcome, no so good.  :)

If the intent was to build this damn so you can store a lot of water so that you could then blow the damn and drown the city, that would also be intent, but an evil intent.  Although this outcome to you is good, the people who are now whitewater rafting toward the ocean may disagree with you.

Doing good things will reinforce your positive and good thinking, and subconsciously make you a better person.  Bad deeds will also imprint themselves on you and eventually take their toll on your psyche.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I think that Intent is a very good measure of 'goodness'. In all of the examples you mention, they do &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; have good intentions, unless you consider killing a good act. I, for one, do not.

The exact quote is &quot;&lt;em&gt;When one performs a good deed out of good intentions...&lt;/em&gt;&quot;. For it to be a good deed out of good intentions, it must first off, not harm anyone. None of the examples you give pass that test.

On to crutches :)

If you think that something or someone can do something for you, and you rely upon that - that is a crutch. When you think that there is an all-powerful God that hands out blessings if you follow his obtuse and obscure rules - and that you can only be blessed if you follow his rules - that's not only a crutch, but it's a monopoloy as well.

Faith ( Belief that does not rest on logical proof or material evidence. as per &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.answers.com/faith&amp;amp;r=67&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Answers.com&lt;/a&gt;) is the opposite of critical thought. It is simply accepting something no matter that there is no logical or emperical evidence supporting it. Faith is almost an anthema to the type of critical thinking that is required in Buddhism. Buddha himself instructed us to not take things on faith - but to think things out ourselves. To experment and try his teachings, and decide for our selves.

For me, that is the major diffrence between Buddhism and most of the other religions out there. Buddhism stresses critical thinking.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Intent:
I agree wholeheartedly that all the examples I gave of intent were awful human beings who did awful things.  The point was that from their point-of-view they were doing good.  They were doing things that had (for them) a good outcome.  The things they did (genocide, for example) are not objectively good, but in their own minds these people were setting things right in the world.  That's why we have to be careful about intent.  People can use it as an excuse to do awful things, even if by their own inner moral compass they are doing what's right and good.  If the intent is to do something good, but something evil results, the intent means a whole lot less and falling back on &quot;my intentions were good&quot; doesn't wash so well.

I do agree with what Mystic says, though, about the cumulative effect of good and bad deeds in your life.  Some call it Karmic Influence, some might say that what a man sows is what he shall reap.

Crutches:
If you ask your wife to make you a lunch is she a &quot;crutch?&quot;  If you ask for help at school from your teacher is your teacher a &quot;crutch?&quot;  If you seek advice and teachings to help you through life by studying Buddhism, is Buddhism a &quot;crutch?&quot;  I do not believe that any human being can achieve their own personal peace and enlightenment without the aid/direction/advice/wisdom/knowlege of other human beings.  We are social creatures with a great and wondrous shared history on planet Earth.  No man is an island, and we achieve great things by working with and learning from each other.  This does not make these things (and that would include religion and faith) a &quot;crutch,&quot; it makes them a tool.  There's a difference between leaning on something for no good reason, and using something to help you out.

Faith:
History is replete with persons of faith who are free-thinking, highly-intelligent, logically-debating, empirically-minded human beings.  There is plenty of &quot;critical thinking&quot; involved in religion and faith.  It is often found under the title of Apologetics.  The &quot;Answers.com&quot; definition is pretty good for a definition of BLIND faith, but to suggest that many of the world's mainline denominations which function around faith in God &quot;is the opposite of critical thought&quot; is, I think, inaccurate.  I would also not agree that &quot;there is no logical or empirical evidence supporting it.&quot;  That's a pretty wild assertion, really, in light of a significant amount of historical and physical evidence supporting persons of faith in their belief in God as related in what is known as the Bible.]]></wp:comment_content>

I would also say that calling someone else's deeply held beliefs 'a crutch' is offensive and borderline boorish behavior.  It would be hard for me to reconcile such an act with Buddhism or Christianity.  I doubt that an examination of the 'intention' or the effect would lead one to the belief that it was a good act.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[On the intent:

Thinking that a good intent will wash away bad acts is not correct. Intent needs to be coupled with acts.

In mystic's example we had good intent, good act, bad outcome (dam for power, built dam, damn broke, big dam problem). This is doing good.

In mystic's second example, we have bad intent, bad action. Still bad.

I can sit and intend to do good all day and night, but with out the corrisponding acts, I get nothing.

Intent is just a yardstick. Good intent, good actions = good Karma. Bad intent, good actions = bad karma. Good intent, bad actions = bad karma. Bad intent, bad actions = bad karma.

Taking hitler, He might have thought that he was doing 'good' by cleansing out the riff raff. However the actions were almost beyond bad. We will never really know what his intentions were - but I cannot belive that he actually thought that he was helping those people.

Crutch:

Point taken, Justus. I am sorry if I offended.

Faith:

These days, we are exposed to the 'radical right' more often then not. I do not belive that every christian thinks that abortion clinic bombings are the way to go, however it does seem like a preponderance of christians do support a roll back of civil rights to match up with their belief structure.

These might simply be a vocal minority, however they do have some sway.

I guess that it's like the problems that the Muslems are facing. People associate all Muslems with the extremest that blow them selves up in crowds of people. Extremeists are a minority.

It would behove moderate Christians to become more vocal in opposing the radicals I guess. Get more face time.

How does this tie into faith? The moderates very well might have a diffrent view of faith then the radicals. Here is my experince with what Faith means:

God is real, because the bible says so. God wrote the bible, and if you do not agree with me, then you are condemmed to hellfire.

Not really nice. But it's what a large percentage of the Christians in this country seem to preach. It is not a message of love, it's a message of conform or be cast down. They throw fits when we try and make this country religion-neutral again. They want to have their religion taught in schools, and cry foul when the tables are turned, and some other religion or philosphy is even mentioned.

That is what I see as 'Faith', and where 'Faith' will bring us.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Tsycho, I assumed that you intended no offense, and you did not offend me.

I think the Christian belief, even amoung fundamentalists, is different than what you imply.

Christians believe that God is real via Faith.  Christians believe that God inspired the bible which contains many truths (some do believe that every word is literally true, but they are a minority.)  One of the bedrock truths, undeniable to Christians, is that salvation is achieved only through Christ.  Therefore, those who do not have faith in Christ will be condemned to hellfire.

While this may seem to be the same idea as what you presented there are some differences.  As an analogy, I believe in Gravity.  I believe that anyone who jumps off the empire state building without a parachutte will fall, strike the ground hard and die a messy death.  Am I condemning jumpers to death?  If I share my vision of the world with people is it not a message of love?  Is it a demand that they conform or be cast down?

Now of course we can confirm gravity through empirical evidence and we cannot confirm God or his rules the same way.  However, most believers claim various ways in which you can know that what they say is true.  Your mileage may vary, but most of them believe that they have in fact confirmed these things to be true through the Holy Spirit etc. etc.

Very few Christians over 20, and very very few of them who are in any way active about their Christianity do not claim to have tested and verified their faith in some way.  It is possible of course that all of these people are decieved, or this 'proof' is an artifact of something else that they do not properly understand, but to call them sheep who never question would be categorically false.  Almost all of them have questioned, and they feel that those questions have been answered.

I also wonder what period of time you are referring to when America was 'religion neutral'?  My study of history has failed to find that time period.  I would also point out that there is a fine line between 'religion neutral' and 'Christian hostile.']]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Okay...no more dead horses.  :)

It is sad that a loud minority does set a visible standard to the general public about Christianity.  I swear, flip a channel on TV and there's some 2-cent prophet telling you all about God's will for your life, ...&quot;and please send God some money...like, to me!&quot;

It is also sad that because of current events many people are living in fear of a perceived Muslim menace to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  There are Muslim extremists out there, and there are also Christian extremists, and Jewish extremists...

Because I come from a Judeo-Christian religious background and have attended many churches (and spent some time in Bible college) I have just enough experience under my belt to have seen a LOT of narrow-minded, extreme, sick behavior by people saying that God has told them this-and-such, and now you should go forth and do likewise no matter how awful those things may be.  It is one of the things that drove me out of organized religion in the first place.

I do know where you're coming from, Tsyko, because I've been inside of it.  It is awful, and it does exist, but it is not the sum total of all the parts of Christendom and organized religion.  Some folks (like me) choose a faith and get very sick at people who preach Christianity under a flag of &quot;turn or burn.&quot;  It's awful, and I know very few people who changed their lives and chose a faith based on the &quot;big stick&quot; approach.

Buddhism offers direction in finding answers to many of life's questions, and I have really enjoyed seeing your posts.  I have at least some better understanding of that way of life, now.  Christianity, too, can offer some direction, as can Judaism, Hinduism, etc.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[In responce to Obidavekenobi's most recent post, I think it is very harmful for anyone to judge a particular group's belief system based on the rantings of fanatics, however, I also feel that it is just as detrimental to not follow your own path.  By that I mean, do not be lead through the nose by the exclusive teachings of your particular group/church/organization.  Be mindful and open to other's views and opinions because, let's face it, none of us really knows who is right when we die.  For all we know Dumbo may be running our world from a spaceship far, far away in a galaxy unknown and we really go nowhere when we die!  A little extreme, I know, but get's the point across, I think!]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[My main issue with Christianity is the bible. A lot of what it says is, IMHO, wrong.

it preaches Turn or Burn. It also says that we are to dominate the natural world. It also says that if we stray, or do not do what God says, we are condemned to Hell (turn or burn, I guess).

There are portions of it that are enlightened, but there are large tracts that are down right fundamental. Sodom and Gomorra, for example. God &lt;em&gt;Killed&lt;/em&gt; two entire towns just because they would not follow his teachings.

This is all based on a literal reading, and I know that some think that these are just fables - but if one part of the word of God is a fable, that throws the rest into doubt.

And, I just say, Hail Dumbo, and I look forward to and accept my new large eared masters.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[IMHO, the majority of what is written in the Old Testament is meant to be taken symbolically.  I don't believe that 1/2 of what is stated there actually happened, but there are some really good messages inclosed.  The New Testament primarily deals with the life and lessons of Jesus.  I know you do not believe that Jesus is your Lord and Savior, as Christians do, but I also know that you believe that he, the man, existed.   He, as the bible states, taught many of the lessons and beliefs that Buddah taught and that you try to live your life by.  How can you say that the Bible is wrong if it is teaching what you preach and believe to be the right way to live one's life?  If one reads the Bible from start to finish, he/she will realize the transformation of God's dealings with 'sinners'. It is almost as if he, himself, matured over the years.  At first he was somewhat ruthless, but by the end, merciful.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[&lt;em&gt;I don't believe that 1/2 of what is stated there actually happened&lt;/em&gt;

So basically we're all in agreement.  The Bible has some good teachings in it, but it's not to be taken literally.

If not taken as 100% true, and is the basis for the teachings of all Christians, where does that leave the Christian faith?]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[What I said is that 1/2 of what the Old Testament says is not to be taken literally...not the whole Bible.  The New Testament, however should.  There is a spacific reason for the separation of the Old and New testaments and I think we've discovered a big part of that here.  The 'whole Christian faith' is based the teachings from the Bible, true, but there are many different ways to teach something.  For example, by ultimate truths and by example or hypathical senario. (refer to Asop's Fables).]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[NSV,

Now you are equating the Bible to Aesop's Fables?  Furthermore, you are claiming that the Bible is now teaching us (only in parts, of course) through hypothetical situations?

Based on these latest revelations, I'm somewhat confused as to where you stand on your own religion.

Let's say a Â¼ of the Bible is not to be taken literally, but only as hypothetical fables, doesn't this ruin the credibility of the entire tome?  I'm curious as to where you have researched your fable theory because I am really interested in your sources.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[NSV;

What mystic is alluding to is that the entire bible is thrown into doubt if part of it is not true. It's like the &lt;a href=&quot;http://dictionary.law.com/definition2.asp?selected=795&amp;amp;bold=%7C%7C%7C%7C&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;fruit of the poisened&lt;/a&gt; tree in legal circles. If X is not true, then X+1 cannot be true.

I would suggest that there might be a grain of truth that the bible is based upon, but it has been diluted by thousands of years of re-telling.

I also feel that the bible is telling us about two very diffrent spiritual systems. The old testiment is all turn or burn, fire and brimstone. The new testiment is about love.

Perhaps Jesus was teaching a break from the old ways? If he was, then why even use the old scriptures as a basis for Christianity? Perhaps we should simply use the Old Testiment as a historical look at the culture that Jesus lived in?

I dunno... but it's a intresting thought.]]></wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>Ethical Conduct:
3. Right Speech
4. Right Action
5. Right Livelihood</blockquote>

	<p>The first part of the path was knowing. It was looking inwards. Now we look outwards. We watch how we interact with the world, and we strive to spread peace rather then unrest.</p>


	<p>Speech is one of the most powerful tools that we have at our disposal. Speech can start wars, or heal years of hate. I was watching a show on Discovery Channel yesterday about the evolution of man from Homo Erectus to Agriculture. One of the most amazing things is the ablity to think in concepts and communicate them. When we were able to reach that level of thinking, things took off. Communication is essential to our culture, our species and our advancement.</p>


	<p>Right speech is to tell the truth, to speak friendly, warm, and gently and to talk only when necessary.</p>


	<p>Right Action ties directly into Right Speech. After all, what is talk with out the walk? We must act kindly and compassionately, be honest, respect the belongings of others, and keep sexual relationships harmless to others.</p>


	<p>At it's core, buddhism is really quite simple and straighforward. Treat others well. Speak with others feelings in your mind. Make your livelihood in accordance with these guidances.</p>


	<p>Right Livelihood is the hard one. Especially in this global economy. You never really know what effects your actions are having across the world. Web Software you develop could be used to assist with weapons transactions across the globe.</p>


	<p>This is where intent comes in. Your actions need to be targeted at spreading good. If you write some code for 'bad' means, then that is bad. If you write some code for good, and it ends up being used for bad, then that's good - not good how it got used, but not your fault some one else brought negitave karma down on themselves by using your code for bad.
(according to <a href="http://www.plumvillage.org">Thich Nath Hanh</a>)</p>


	<pre><code>Four of the Five Mindfulness Trainings:</code></pre>


<blockquote><del><em>First Training</em></del>

	<p>Aware of the suffering caused by the destruction of life, I am committed to cultivating compassion and learning ways to protect the lives of people, animals, plants, and minerals. I am determined not to kill, not to let others kill, and not to condone any act of killing in the world, in my thinking, and in my way of life.</p>


	<p><del><em>Second Training</em></del></p>


	<p>Aware of the suffering caused by exploitation, social injustice, stealing, and oppression, I am committed to cultivate loving kindness and learn ways to work for the well-being of people, animals, plants, and minerals. I am committed to practice generosity by sharing my time, energy, and material resources with those who are in real need. I am determined not to steal and not to possess anything that should belong to others. I will respect the property of others, but I will prevent others from profiting from human suffering or the suffering of other species on Earth.</p>


	<p><del><em>Third Training</em></del></p>


	<p>Aware of the suffering caused by sexual misconduct, I am committed to cultivate responsibility and learn ways to protect the safety and integrity of individuals, couples, families, and society. I am determined not to engage in sexual relations without love and a long-term commitment. To preserve the happiness of myself and others, I am determined to respect my commitments and the commitments of others. I will do everything in my power to protect children from sexual abuse and to prevent couples and families from being broken by sexual misconduct.</p>


	<p><del><em>Fourth Training</em></del></p>


	<p>Aware of the suffering caused by unmindful speech and the inability to listen to others, I am committed to cultivate loving speech and deep listening in order to bring joy and happiness to others and relieve others of their suffering. Knowing that words can create happiness or suffering, I am committed to learn to speak truthfully, with words that inspire self-confidence, joy, and hope. I am determined not to spread news that I do not know to be certain and not to criticize or condemn things of which I am not sure. I will refrain from uttering words that can cause division or discord, or that can cause the family or the community to break. I will make all efforts to reconcile and resolve all conflicts, however small.</blockquote></p>


	<p>-<a href="http://www.thebigview.com/buddhism/index.html">The Big View</a></p>


	<p>Mindfulness is definded as</p>


<blockquote>The practice whereby a person is intentionally aware of his or her thoughts and actions in the present moment, non-judgmentally.</blockquote>

	<p>-<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindfulness">Wikipedia</a></p>


	<p>Mindfulness is a very important part of Buddhism. By becoming reflexively introspective, you reach a point where you can make choices based not on fleeting feelings, but rather on what is best for you and the others that your choice will effect.</p>


	<p>Using these tools, Buddhists should strive to bring more peace and harmony into the world. They should leave the world better then they found it - like the Boy Scouts who are admonished to 'leave the camp site cleaner then they found it'.</p>


	<p>We are all camping in this world, sharing it's fire. We should leave it cleaner then we found it, more advanced in sciences and humanities, and an all around better place for those who follow us.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I really do not know. That portion puzzled me as well.

The only thing that I could come up with is to  interpet it as talking about the entire Earth - being concerned about the wellbeing of the Earth, and the entire Universe. Not taking actions that will harm the Earth. Using the American Indian thought, and looking at the issues caused by an action for 7 generations before taking that action.

While I do not totally agree with that (after all, I am a proponent of Nuclear Power), I think that it's a good target to aim for.

When we take the time and dollars to develop really green power generation (be it solar, fusion, geothermal, wind or what have you) we will leave the Earth in better shape, and that will help generations further down the line.

Oh wow. That was quite the rant.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="center" cellpadding="20"> <tbody><tr> <td align="center"> <font size="5"><b>Snuffleupagus</b></font><tr> <td align="center"> <img src="http://is3.okcupid.com/users/168/570/16957172787179881552/mt1129991903.jpg"/> </td> </tr><br /> You scored 43% Organization, 51% abstract,  and 52% extroverted! </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <font size="-2">This test measured 3 variables. </font><p>
<font color="red">First, this test measured how <b>organized</b> you are.  Some muppets like Cookie Monster make big messes, while others like Bert are quite anal about things being clean. </font></p><p>
<font color="blue">Second, this test measured if you prefer a <b>concrete</b> or an <b>abstract</b> viewpoint.  For the purposes of this test, concrete people are considered to gravitate more to <i> mathematical and logical approaches</i>, whereas abstract people are more the <i> dreamers and artistic type.</i></font></p><p>
<font color="green">Third, this test measured if you are more of an <b>introvert</b> or an <b>extrovert.</b>
By definition, an introvert concentrates more on herself and an
extrovert focuses more on others. In this test an introvert was
somebody that either tends to spend more time alone or thinks more
about herself. </font></p><p>
You are <b>somewhat</b> organized, <b>both </b>concrete and abstract, and <b>both </b>introverted and extroverted.</p><p>

	<p>I bet you didn't think you were Snuffleupagus.  Let's find out why.</p><p></p>


<font color="purple">You are both somewhat organized. You have a good
idea where you put things and you probably keep your place reasonably
clean. You aren't totally obsessed with neatness though. Alloyius
Snuffleupagus (and all Snuffleupagus') is not sloppy by nature, but he
moves so incredibly slowly that it is impossible for him to be totally
organized.<br /><br />
You both are about equally concrete and abstract thinkers. You have a
good balance in your life. You know when to be logical at times, but
you also aren't afraid to explore your dreams and desires... within
limits of course. Snuffy generally has very basic interests, but he
explores his abstract sensitive side when he plays his snuffleflute.<br /><br />
You both are somewhat introverted. Originally Snuffleupagus was very
shy and was only Big Bird's invisible friend. However as he has aged he
has started to build new friendships with new characters. Like Snuffy,
you probably like to have some time to yourself. However, you do
appreciate spending time with your friends, and you aren't scared of
social situations. </font></p><p></p><p>
The other possible characters are<br /><b>
<font color="brown">Oscar the Grouch<br />
Big Bird<br />
Cookie Monster<br />
Ernie<br />
Elmo<br />
Kermit the Frog<br />
Grover<br />
The Count<br />
Guy Smiley<br />
Bert
</font></b>
</p><p>
If you enjoyed this test, I would love the feedback! Also if you want
to tell me your favorite Sesame Street character, I can total them up
and post them here. Perhaps your choice will win! </p></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <br /><br /><br /> <table cellpadding="20"> <tbody><tr> <td> <span id="comparisonarea">My test tracked 3 variables How you compared to other people <i>your age and gender</i>:<blockquote><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="4"><tbody><tr><td valign="middle"><table bgcolor="black" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="1"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#b2cfff" height="20" width="27"><a href="http://www.okcupid.com"><img src="http://is0.okcupid.com/graphics/0.gif" alt="free online dating" border="0"/></a></td><td bgcolor="white" width="123"><a href="http://www.okcupid.com"><img src="http://is0.okcupid.com/graphics/0.gif" alt="free online dating" border="0"/></a></td></tr></tbody></table></td><td valign="middle">You scored higher than <b>18%</b> on <b>Organization</b></td></tr><tr><td valign="middle"><table bgcolor="black" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="1"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#b2cfff" height="20" width="68"><a href="http://www.okcupid.com"><img src="http://is0.okcupid.com/graphics/0.gif" alt="free online dating" border="0"/></a></td><td bgcolor="white" width="82"><a href="http://www.okcupid.com"><img src="http://is0.okcupid.com/graphics/0.gif" alt="free online dating" border="0"/></a></td></tr></tbody></table></td><td valign="middle">You scored higher than <b>45%</b> on <b>concrete-abstra</b></td></tr><tr><td valign="middle"><table bgcolor="black" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="1"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#b2cfff" height="20" width="47"><a href="http://www.okcupid.com"><img src="http://is0.okcupid.com/graphics/0.gif" alt="free online dating" border="0"/></a></td><td bgcolor="white" width="103"><a href="http://www.okcupid.com"><img src="http://is0.okcupid.com/graphics/0.gif" alt="free online dating" border="0"/></a></td></tr></tbody></table></td><td valign="middle">You scored higher than <b>31%</b> on <b>intro-extrovert</b></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote></span> </td> </tr> </tbody></table> <table cellpadding=20><tr><td>Link: <a href='http://www.okcupid.com/tests/take?testid=4525550649363613939'>The Your <span class="caps">SESAME STREET</span> Persona Test</a> written by <a href='http://www.okcupid.com/profile?tuid=16957172787179881552'>greencowsgomoo</a> on <a href='http://www.okcupid.com'>Ok Cupid</a>, home of the <a href='http://www.okcupid.com/oktest3'>32-Type Dating Test</a></td></tr></table>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>...the Kansas Board of Education approved new public-school science standards Tuesday that cast doubt on the theory of evolution.

	<p>The 6-4 vote was a victory for 'intelligent designâ€ advocates who helped draft the standards. Intelligent design holds that the universe is so complex that it must have been created by a higher power...</p>


	<p>...In addition, the board rewrote the definition of science, so that it is no longer limited to the search for natural explanations of phenomena.</blockquote></p>


	<p>-<a href="http://msnbc.msn.com/id/9967813/"><span class="caps">MSNBC</span></a></p>


	<p>This is one of the reasons that I fear Christianity as it is practiced in America, especially by the far right conservative movement. As a Religion, it seems bent on legislating it's point of view. Forcing everyone to agree with them. Abolishing freedom of religion and choice.</p>


	<p>Some in this country seem to wish nothing more then to take away the freedom of choice that they believe God himself gave to us. Now they want to even change our definition of science? I have no problem with ID being taught in school - as a religious theory, in a religion class. Science and religion are two very different things, and should be treated as such.</p>


	<p>Our schools should be a place where our young are taught to think and to reason. If religion is to be taught, then all of them should be explored. Christianity, Wicca, Buddhism and the rest. However, it is my opinion that Religion should not be taught in schools at all. That is best left to the parents.</p>


	<p>Everyone should have the freedom to raise their children as they see fit. Even Christian fundamentalists.</p>

It's always good to make sure that you are on the same page with what the words mean that you are talking about.

A belief that by understanding more about the Universe making our time here better is not religion - it's grounded in fact. Our ancestors found that life was better after they discovered fire - we have found that life was better after we discovered penicillin. Those are facts. and we can look to this past preformance to say that the chances of Science improving our lives again is fairly high.


Religion does not deal in proof. It deals in Faith. Faith is a very important part of life, however it is not based on proof.

So, I would say that Science is definitely not religion. Belief in Science as a vehicle to improve life is not faith based - it's based on well documented, empirical past performance.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I actually heard the story on the drive home Thursday. There was a follow up article, which NPR seems to not have in the text. It was talking about a meeting of ID'ers at a college. Most had bibles openly displayed. All of them spoke of fear about being fired if they brought up their beliefs.

I would posit that the ID'er are trying to bring religion into science. The evidence about parts of the evolution of life on our planet has holes in it. This does not prove that some mystical force is at work. It simply means that we need to do more research.

Honestly, we might find a 'mystical' explanation to the holes. No one knows, until we do that research. However, we have to have an open mind and thick skins. If some one wants to bring a theory forward, they should be prepared to have it torn to shreds.

I think that any theory that relies upon the working of magic will be torn to shreds, and treated with disdain unless there is some compelling evidence for it (take, for example the propagation of information at rates faster then light by some subatomic particles).

I am in no way condoning the alleged actions of the people involved in Mr. Sternberg's case. However, there is a long history of religion trying to control science. Can we blame folks who look up to such people as Galleo? We all know that he was treated rather poorly by the church. When religion tries to propose a theory with no evidence - only the lack of some evidence in the current theory, can we blame the scientific community for not taking them really seriously?]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I certainly don't deny that many supporters of ID do so because of their religious beliefs.  Many scientists over the years, including Einstein, had deep religious beliefs and those beliefs effected their science.

However, the Scientific establishment contains it's own dogma and heirarchies.  Bjorn Lomborg certainly found that out when he challenged some of the data behind Global Warming.

What interests me most about intelligent design is whether or not we could tell if some intelligent force has influenced the development of life on earth.

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I guess the question is if there is any credible evidence that there was Magic in the creation/evolution of life on this world. I doubt it very highly. Everthing that I have read from the ID side is not evidence in support of their theory, rather it is holes they have found in the theory of evolution. Poking holes in some one else's theory with out presenting a credible replacement is not following the scientific process. It's just being a jackass.

Saying 'it was magic' is not a crediable theory - with out some, any, evidence.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erich_von_D%C3%A4niken&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Erich von DÃ¤niken&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chariots_of_the_Gods&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Chariots of the Gods&lt;/a&gt; was ridiculed as well - does that mean that he is right? Should we put resources into proving or disproving his theories? Or is it only Christian inspired theories that we should accept and study with out even a modicum of logic behind them?

The scientific communities rejection of an idea does not mean that the idea is true or false. It means that the members of the scientific community that have taken time to comment on it &lt;b&gt;felt&lt;/b&gt; that it failed some portion of the scientific process.

Many theories were not accepted at first. Look at the history of Quantum Physics for example - Einstein's famous quote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Quantum mechanics is certainly imposing. But an inner voice tells me it is not yet the real thing. The theory says a lot, but does not really bring us any closer to the secret of the Old One. I, at any rate, am convinced that He does not throw dice.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Dissension about the entire branch of physics that has brought us microcomputers and cell phones. But Bohr kept on, and had a thick enough skin to not let it get to him.


As far as Einstein's religious views - I will let him respond:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It was, of course, a lie what you read about my religious convictions, a lie which is being systematically repeated. I do not believe in a personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly. If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our science can reveal it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

and

&lt;blockquote&gt;[Buddhism] has the characteristics of what would be expected in a cosmic religion for the future: It transcends a personal God, avoids dogmas and theology; it covers both the natural and the spiritual, and it is based on a religious sense aspiring from the experience of all things, natural and spiritual, as a meaningful unity.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If we were to accept ID as science, then we would have to accept the Native American traditions, Wiccan, Buddhist, Vedic, Shinto and all of the others. Heck, why not Babylonian?

ID has no logical consistency, other then 'well, you cannot prove that it did not happen'. Lack of disproof is not a basis for a theory.

Just for completeness:

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.answers.com/theory&amp;amp;r=67&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;theÂ·oÂ·ry&lt;/a&gt; (thÄ“'É™-rÄ“, thÃ®r'Ä“)
A set of statements or principles devised to explain a group of facts or phenomena, especially one that has been repeatedly tested or is widely accepted and can be used to make predictions about natural phenomena.

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Ah, back to the ID thing again are we? ;)

&lt;blockquote&gt;I certainly don't deny that many supporters of ID do so because of their religious beliefs.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Who else would support ID if not for religious folks?

&lt;blockquote&gt;What interests me most about intelligent design is whether or not we could tell if some intelligent force has influenced the development of life on earth. That is where the critics of intelligent design tend to bother me. Rather than addressing if we could know, or how we could know they seem on the whole to be demanding that it is impossible that it could have happened. I think the meta questions of how we could know are important even if it didn't happen and the refussal to even address those questions strikes me as being profoundly anti-scientific.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The question of whether or not some intelligent force has influenced the development of life on Earth is indeed interesting, it's just not science, it's metaphysics.  It raises questions that cannot be explained by science, therefore, these are not scientific questions.

Many religious folks are trying their darnedest to move ID into the scientific community.  I would think that if any remote ounce of ID were based on scientific facts that they would bring this to the table in their argument.  Since we have never seen any such data, it pretty much means there isn't any to be found.  Not yet at least.

If ID is not provable to be a science-based study, then it should remain out of the scientific community, and yes, that means our children's science books.  Trying to force scientists to add ID into their books does not make it science, it makes followers of ID very questionable.

Go study ID and ask your questions all you want to.  Who's stopping you?  When you get something worthwhile, come back and talk to us.  Until the time comes when you bring real scientific evidence to the table about ID, stop trying to shove this man-made fairytale down our children's throats and passing it off for real science.

Although the questions that the possibility of ID brings to the discussion are interesting, I choose not to waste my time with them because I don't feel they are relevant any more then trying to prove the existence of the Galactic Chicken or the Flying Spaghetti Monster.  Our time on this Earth is limited, and spending time studying mythological pursuits seems to be a waste when so many other things need to be studied.

Spending your time studying cures for diseases is a more lofty use of your time then memorizing every phrase of a book based on tales to scare unbelievers.  Heck, just using that time to spend with my daughters is infinitely more appealing then wondering how a Moses parted the Red Sea.

I'm not saying people should not study the idea of ID if that's what floats their boat, I just don't want it forced onto others.  It seems throughout history many religions have tried to force themselves on others.  We're currently knee-deep in a war for that very reason.

In the past entire cities have been destroyed right down to the women, children and animals because people did not believe how others thought they should believe.  By forcing your belief system into our schools and government you are following in the footsteps of others that have come before you.  The argument that ID belongs in our science classes is nothing short of attempted brainwashing.

Christians have been freaking out recently because people are trying to make this country more generic when it comes to religion, and Christians are afraid they will lose their foothold as the dominant religion.  They are in a state of panic because apparently allowing others to practice their religious beliefs, or at least stepping aside so others have a chance to worship how they like, is a bad thing.

All religions function by trying to make themselves desirable for followers to join.  It's all about marketing.  When competition comes along then historically religions pull out all the stops to prevent their flocks from dwindling.

Here's a question for you to ponder.  If Christians are secure in their belief and know that it is the only path we should follow through life, why do they try so hard to remain in our government and schools?  Why not just be content to worship in their churches and not try so hard to force their way into society as a whole?  Because like any organization they need numbers to retain power.  Small numbers mean less of an influence on just about everything.

Religion is a business.  They collect money, buy property, and find loopholes to operate 'in the blackâ€.  Without a steady source of income, their flock, they will shrivel up and waste away.  Sure you will go to Hell if you don't give to your church, but what they really mean is that if you don't give they will disappear, not you.

Want to climb up on your soapbox and beat the drums of how ID should be allowed into our school science classes now?  Go ahead, but you'd better bring something more substantial to your discussion other then the question of 'whether or not we could tell if some intelligent force has influenced the development of life on earth'.

My two cents in the grand scheme of life on Earth.  :)]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I claimed that Einstein's religion (perhaps a better term would have been spirituality) inspired and effected his science.  I stand by that claim.  I never claimed he was Christian.

ID of course is not Chritianity, and those Christians who support it for theological reasons are, in my opinion, guilty of some pretty bad theology.  The 'God of the Gaps' strain of theology is a very poor one indeed.

&lt;i&gt;I guess the question is if there is any credible evidence that there was Magic in the creation/evolution of life on this world.&lt;/i&gt;

That is the opposite of the question I am asking.  Intelligent interference is not magic (although as has often been noted a sufficiently advanced technology can appear magical.)

&lt;i&gt;The question of whether or not some intelligent force has influenced the development of life on Earth is indeed interesting, it's just not science, it's metaphysics.&lt;/i&gt;

I disagree.  Scientists look all the time for evidence that intelligent activity has left its footprints on the natural world.  A good portion of archeology is devoted to just that.  If science can't tell the difference between random mutations and deliberately designed changes, it seems a very insufficient tool to me.  I don't think that science is unable to tell the difference.  It may, in some cases be very difficult to tell but I don't think the quest is impossible.

Intelligent Design of course exists.  We do it.

Imagine if a nuclear war or similar holocaust ravaged the earth today.  In thousands of years humanity manages to struggle back to our present level of technology.  Would those scientists be able to determine that glow in the dark fish were created by intelligent design?  I don't know if they could or not, but the question is interesting and certainly seems to me to be well in the scope of science.

I think their are legitimate questions about whether ID should be part of a high school cariculum.  It is easily argued that it requires too much knowlege of evolutionary theory, graduate level college  rather than high school level to understand and even debate ID.  That seems to me to be something that voters, parents, and school boards can decide though, and doesn't need court involvement.  I would probably vote against it personally.

As to whether ID has much scientific basis behind it in its current form, that is hard to say.  The NPR story I linked to implies that it is difficult for the science to get a fair hearing.

I certainly agree that ID is not a fully formed scientific theory at this point.  At the least though the study of ID is an attempt to falsify a portion of the theory of evolution, the idea that random mutation etc. can explain the diversity of life on earth.  To that extend, at the very least, it is science.  Falsifing another theory, even if you own competing theory remains incomplete is an integral part of science.   Attempting to falsify a theory that has gained wide acceptance has never been a popular activity though, and I think we are seeing a lot of that in this debate.

Note:  Falsifying 'evolution' doesn't mean that evolution doesn't happen or that 99% of diversity of life on earth can't be explained by it.  Newton's theories were 'false' but work perfectly in most situations.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Evolutionary science does not deal with a universal scale either.  Our sample size, so far is a single planet.  Indeed that is at the heart of the difficulty.  If human evolution was determined to be a million to one chance that doesn't tell us much, the fact that we are asking the question says that we beat the odds.  If though, we found a dozen worlds with life, and all had fairly close analogues of humanity and we still figured that the chance of such a thing happening randomly was a million to one in each case, we would probably suspect that something had altered the odds.

Our sample size is too small.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[With a sample of 1, we cannot determine the chances of something happening or not. Either it does nor does not. In fact, at this time, we have to say that there is a 100% chance of human life developing on Earth. Until we can get solid evidence of other earth like worlds, talking about the chances of life developing on them is just hyperbole, and not at all relevant to this discussion.

The perception in the real world is that ID is a right wing Christian initiative. Perhaps it has been co-opted by that group, but the fact is that people believe that it is a religious movement. The IDers are not doing anything to counter this.

All that they do is &quot;&lt;em&gt;argue that any phenomenon or feature that cannot be fully explained through conventional evolutionary views is evidence of intervention of one or more intelligent entities&lt;/em&gt;&quot; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_design&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;).

If I could be shown any evidence that ID is based at all in fact, then I could probably accept it. However, we have no evidence that some mysterious unnamed 'intelligence' is responsible for 'filling in' those 'gaps'.

Let's look at it this way.

ID claims 'It has been calculated that the odds of one protein molecule, a hundred amino acids long, coming into being by chance alone are approximately 1 X 10-65th power. 10 to the 65th approximates the number of atoms in the Milky Way. A single bacterial cell, which would have to be magnified over a million times to even be visible, contains 100 billion atoms. I think you see where this is going. Life is exceedingly improbable. '

However, We have found Amino Acids in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cv.nrao.edu/~awootten/allmols.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;interstellar space&lt;/a&gt;.

But this intelligent Creator could have Placed them there for us to find!

And God could have faked the entire fossil record as well.  It's a circular argument.  People once believed that Angels pushed the planets around the heavens. There was a big gap in folk's understanding of the universe (they did not have any theory of Gravity at the time). If folks had simply accepted that 'theory' and not explored any more - we would not be where we are today.

Simply accepting &quot;someone did it' and not trying to figure out (if indeed some one else did do it) how they did it, or how it just happened we will be worse off.

It seems to me that IDers try and take the easy way out. 'It's too complex! Some one must have done it!' simply does not wash with me. Each time in history that claim has been made, Humanity has risen to the challenge, and figured it out.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I think many ID proponants do try to counter the Religious perception of ID.

I have consistantly maintained that while ID fascinates me, it has not convinced me.  I don't think it has nearly as much evidence behind it's theories as many of its proponants claim.

However, the detractors of ID seem far more 'religious' in nature to me and seem to behave in a consistantly unscientific manner.  While I don't think they should accept the conclusions that ID proponants have made at this point, they also seem determined to ignore any data that might support ID.  That is troubling.

The other thing that I question is simply refusing 'someone did it' as a possible answer seems foolish, as I have tried to illustrate above.  The inherent assumption that if someone did something science cannot detect it and cannot learn from it seems very limiting to me.  I think science can answer the question of whether something was created or happened by chance.  We might not have the data to determine that at this point in time, but the question isn't outside the realm of science, and thinking about how we could know such a thing seems very useful.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[However, simply saying &quot;we don't know how it happened, so some one must have done it&quot; is not good science either.

A true scientific approach would not rule out anything that we could find proof for. However, at this time we have no proof that ID is true, and none has been offered up.

Applying Occam's Razor to the issue - adding in the added complexity of an Intellegent Designer to the theorys that govern the creation of life on this world are not warrented with out some evidence. ID is all 'God in the Gaps' right now (at least what I have seen). If there is more, if there are fingerprints left then I would like to see the evidence.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I might be able to wrap my brain around the possibility of ID as being 'seededâ€ by space travelers or something, but I would never buy into the theory that this planet, and all life on it, was engineered by some super intellectual being just because we are a part of a complex biosphere that they cannot explain yet.

It's sure a fun topic to discuss though. ;)]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[ID proponants of course claim that they have evidence at least of things that currently can't be explained and seem to be evidence of intelligence rather than chance.

In all honesty, I don't have nearly enough biology to evaluate those claims.  Of course most scientists dispute those claims, but it seems to me that at least some, perhaps most, of the disputation is not so much that the ID proponents are wrong, but that they are unscientific even for asking the question or pointing out the data.

It seems to me, that evolution is, at best, incomplete and scientists should be a little more frank in acknowledging that there is a lot about the process that we don't understand and can't explain.  That would, in my opinion, weaken ID proponants position rather than strengthening it.

It is not uncommon for scientists (and all of us for that matter) to acknowledge intellectually that we don't know everything, but to respond emotionally to percieved attacks at our lack of knowledge.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The only evidence that I have ever seen is:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Positive evidence of design in living systems consists of the semantic, meaningful or functional nature of biological information, the lack of any known law that can explain the sequence of symbols that carry the &quot;messages,&quot; and statistical and experimental evidence that tends to rule out chance as a plausible explanation. Other evidence challenges the adequacy of natural or material causes to explain both the origin and diversity of life.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
(&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.intelligentdesignnetwork.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Intellegent Design Network&lt;/a&gt;)

This does not talk about hard evidence. It simply points out &lt;em&gt;the lack of any known law that can explain&lt;/em&gt; their issues with Evolution.

How can you take up the side of something that according to you &lt;em&gt; I don't have nearly enough biology to evaluate those claims&lt;/em&gt;? Is it just a feeling that this 'should be' or is there some logical basis? I ask this not out of disrepect, but rather out of intrest. Why do people support ideas that have no basis in established fact, and cannot be logically or rationally supported?

Inquiring minds want to know..]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Holy Macaroni, Batman!  You guys have been busy on this topic!  It took me 30 minutes to read all your posts.  Very worthy discussion, indeed, and no discussion about crutches! *L*  I imagine it has all been spurred by the Supreme Court battles as of late, yes?  Also the Kansas BOE bit.

Being just tired enough after having done research online all night long (BTW, I HATE my schedule) regarding faith, religion, logic, and relativism, I have only a couple of thoughts for y'all...

The question of why people of faith keep trying to let &quot;God&quot; remain in Government, etc: Because they think they have the miracle cure to all of life's problems.  It's a matter of philosophy (literally).  If I had the cure for cancer I wouldn't keep it to myself.  People of faith often believe they have the miracle cure and are morally compelled to spread it by whatever means possible.

Evolution is a Thoery.  Intelligent Design is a Theory.  Both have arguments to support their conclusions, but neither conclusion has been proven completely true or completely false.  The jury is still out.  I am glad that we, as a society and a species, keep asking questions.  Perhaps someday we'll have answers.  We MUST keep asking the questions, and we therefore MUST keep postulating the theories.

Until then we act on faith and apply reason, and that is not such a bad thing.  ;)]]></wp:comment_content>

Perhaps I have not been clear.  I don't believe in intelligent design.  I highly doubt that aliens have been involved in our planets develoopment and I am sure that if there is a supreme being, God, that science will be unable to detect his influence and ID is barking up the wrong tree.  As I have mentioned, ID is horrible theology.

What I support is asking the questions.  First off, I think that the ID research that is mostly focused on falsifying evolution as we now understand it is very useful.  I expect that the ultimate result of that will be new understanding of how evolution occurs, probably as signifigant and Einstein rewriting Newton.

What I oppose is the puritanical opposition to ID that I see from the scientific community.  They say ID=religion therefore end of discussion.  I think that that is a misunderstanding.

I also think that it is good science to ask, and try to answer, what are the marks of intelligence and how can we differentiate between a caused event and a random happening.  Doubtless we will not be able to answer that question completely, but there are many many scientific lines of inquiry that we may not be able to answer completely and yet we still try.

I also reject the notion that teaching ID in schools will damage kids in any way or prevent them from getting a good scientific background.  In many ways, one could argue that the reverse is even more true.  If science demands that God cannot be present (which it doesn't but it is spun that way) then believers (of which there are many) will be turned off by science.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[It can be taught, just not in science classes as science. :)

I too believe in a healthy dose of skepticism when it comes to science. It would be criminal not to challenge scientific discoveries.  How else can we catch the dolts who create new non-existent dinosaurs from fossils spanning multiple creatures, or any of a number of other scientists who are just flat out wrong about various things in their respective fields of study?

Sometimes we don't find out these scientists were wrong for decades!

On the other hand, at least these scientists had tangible evidence to study and disprove, ID followers do not.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I agree with Mystic. It is metaphysics - not science. It has 0 - no evidence that it can point to  other then our inablity to explain how it happened down to the most nitpicky levels.

I would have no problem with it presented in a metaphysics, or religion class.

ID does not even meet the requrments for a Theory, Obi. It barely meets the requirements for a hypothesis. Science is based on evidence. Show me ANY evidence that ID has. I have been all over their websites looking for it. It's all pointing at the gaps in our understanding.

It is not science, and it should not be presented in a science class. It has no evidentary basis.

&lt;blockquote&gt;A central concept in the philosophy of science is empiricism, or dependence on evidence. Empiricism is the view that knowledge derives from experience of the world. In this sense, scientific statements are subject to and derived from our experiences or observations. Scientific hypotheses are developed and tested through empirical methods consisting of observations and experiments. Once reproduced widely enough, the information resulting from our observations and experiments counts as the evidence upon which the scientific community develops theories that purport to explain facts about the world.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I agree that science should be held under a critical eye - but to propose a theory with out any evidence? That would be like your doctor deciding to remove your appendix becuase he just felt like it.]]></wp:comment_content>

I think it is very hard though to make the case the constitutionally it cannot be taught.

Presuming the constitution allows it to be taught, then the question that would remain is who decides, and clearly it seems to me that a State Board of Education is an appropriate venue.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Theory, as it is used in Science is considered 'jargon' and is not part of the 'normal' lexicon. It has a very specific definition in the Scientific Method.

Mr. Webster, in the case of how it is used in Science, is wrong.

From &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.answers.com/theory&amp;amp;r=67&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Answers.com&lt;/a&gt;
Science
theory

In science, an explanation or model that covers a substantial group of occurrences in nature and has been confirmed by a substantial number of experiments and observations. A theory is more general and better verified than a hypothesis. (See Big Bang theory, evolution, and relativity.)

As far as the scientific method:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Once an hypothesis is repeatedly verified through experiment, it is considered to be a theory and new predictions are based upon it. Any erroneous predictions, internal inconsistencies or lacunae, or unexplained phenomena, initiate the generation correction to hypotheses, which are themselves tested, and so on. Any hypothesis which is cogent enough to make predictions can be tested in this way.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

ID cannot be tested - ergo it cannot be a theory.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I don't know that it is true that ID cannot be tested.  I will agree that we haven't come up with a good test for ID as of yet.

The big bang didn't have any testable predictions at first, but as our understanding of quantum mechanices and our ability to see further and clearer improved we were able to make some tests and confirm some results.

I would in fact expect intervention by intelligence to look different than natural evolution.  However, since we are peering into the past and can only see dimly, and since intelligent intervention, by the ID proponents own admission, is rare at best in our evolutionary history it would be difficult to find.

Intelligent Design, as a theory, would predict that eventually we will observe this effect.  Given the 'eventually' it is probably not falsifiable.

Falsifiability though it not the only criterion for something to be science, or even scientific theory.  Falsifiability is itself controversial and claimed by many scientists to be of limited usefulness as a concept.

Beyond that of course, Intelligent Design proponants would probably claim that they have observed intelligent design already (I am skeptical of that) they have a list of candidates of mutations that they claim exhibit the properties of intelligent design.  Observation is of course also science, and does not need to be falsifiable.  If one could say with authority, I have observed something that can only be attributable to intelligence then that observation has to be incorperated into scientific theory.]]></wp:comment_content>

and

&quot;supreme being, God, that science will be unable to detect his influence&quot;

The major issue with this is that we have only one set of data to look at. To detect intellegent design, we would need a baseline (non-intellegent design) to compare ourselves to. We can point to things which 'might be' evidence, but it's all speculation at this point.

The big bang was concived of after Edwin Hubble showed that the universe was expanding. That was it's testable prediction. The universe is already expanding. Where is it expanding from and why? Enter singularity. :)

Many of the current crop of accepted theorys are trying to explain evidence that we have in front of us. ID is trying to explain a lack of evidence with a magic wand.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hubble observed that the universe was expanding before the big bang theory was formed.  Hence the big bang theory explained, but did not predict the expanding universe.

Was Hubbles dectection of an expanding universe falsifiable?  Not as the term is generally thought of.

Of course Hubble's dectection of an expanding universe could have been the symptom of a periodically expanding and contracting universe.  If I recall correctly, that was an alternate theory about the phenomenon that was bandied around quite a bit.  The detection of a smooth level of background radiation, predicted by the big bang theory, was what gave the big bang theory the edge in that debate (as I recall.)

Of course it would be tautology, not a theory, to claim that evidence of intelligent design has been observed in our evolutionary histroy therefore an intelligence has design portions of our biology.  If true though, it would be, despite any inability to make predictions, an important part of science.  If some intelligent being is fucking with natural laws we would have to take that into account in studying natural laws.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Uh.. that's what I said.

As an intresting aside:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The expansion of the universe created an interesting episode for general relativity. Starting in 1922, researchers found that cosmological solutions of the Einstein field equations call for an expanding universe. Einstein did not believe in an expanding universe, and so he added a cosmological constant to the field equations to permit the creation of static universe solutions. In 1929, Edwin Hubble found evidence that the universe is expanding. This resulted in Einstein dropping the cosmological constant, referring to it as &quot;the biggest blunder in my career&quot;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The expanding universe was found in General Relativity, so the Big E edited it out. Then Hubble found that the universe was expanding. The big E then ate some crow. :)

The Big Bang theory was just taking the expansion and running it back to it's start. It must have expanded from somewhere, no?]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I doubt we will ever see a good test for ID.  It might defeat the purpose.  I am reminded of the &quot;Babel Fish&quot; from Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.  '...and God disappears in a puff of logic.'

The universe is full of things we can observe but not fully explain or understand  (like Hubble's observations in the 1920's).  We record, analyze with the means available, ask more questions, and keep on truckin'.

Hypothesis or Theory, six of one, half a dozen of the other.  By saying something doesn't fit into a specific box doesn't make it an invalid assertion.  I was trying to say that, I guess.

And, to assert that something isn't &quot;remotely conceivable&quot; sorta' stunts our research and growth, don't you think?  They once said that about man on the moon, or that the world was round, etc.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I think that the point of having a scientific method is to lay down the ground rules, as it were. To just throw out those rules 'because something makes sense to me' invalidates the entire process. By saying that something does not fit into the box of Scientific Process, makes it not part of science. You cannot have it both ways (unless you do what the School Board in question did, and just re-define science to suit their needs).

Science deals in facts, metaphysics deals in faith. Let's leave ID in the realm of Metaphysics until they can meet the burden of proof that the scientific method requires.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[This entire conversation has gotten me thinking. Why? Why do so many people have a hard time really understanding what the scientific community is talking about in this debate?

&lt;blockquote&gt;Futter traces the controversy, in part, to a general scientific illiteracy in American society. A recent international survey of fourth- and eighth-graders ranked the United States' students 17th in basic understanding of science. Another poll shows half of all Americans reject the theory of evolution.

The problem, Futter said, includes a basic misunderstanding of the scientific definition of a theory, as in &quot;the theory of evolution,'' or Einstein's &quot;theory of relativity.''

&quot;A theory is not a hunch, not mere speculation,'' Futter said. &quot;It's something that's met the most thorough standards of scientific proof.'' As Eldredge says in one video display, &quot;theories aren't facts. Theories explain facts.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

-- &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hds.harvard.edu/cswr/research/ecology/bio_futter.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Ellen Futter&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.newstimeslive.com/story.php?id=76915&amp;amp;category=Regional&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;News Times Live&lt;/a&gt;

This entire controversy can be traced back to schools that fail our children. They do not teach what Science really is. Things like Webster's really bad definition of a theory are systemic of this problem.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Well, I wouldn't call the Webster's Dictionary a second-hand tool at word definition.  Still, it must truly depend upon your point-of-view.  I see merit in both definitions, but we must be careful not to choose to convenient a definition to support our research; that's bias.

There are so many issues yet to be discovered and decided concerning the theory of evolution.  I think the schools fail in presenting it as an established fact, but they do well to keep our children's minds fresh and open.No scientist worth his salt would stand up and say that evolution is the one and only 100% infallible explanation of the origin of life on this planet.  I have no problem accepting that it is a set of observable facts that form &quot;Probable Cause,&quot; but &quot;Proof Beyond a Reasonable Doubt?&quot;  I think not.  There is still &quot;Reasonable Doubt&quot; in the theory; that's why the scientific community keeps working for it, and that's okay by me.

The entire debate can be traced back to people having different opinions about truth.  To suggest that the schools are at fault for not properly indoctrinating children is almost begging the question.]]></wp:comment_content>

Let's just simplify it even further and say that some people base their truth on reality and facts, while others base their truth on make-believe.  Should schools teach facts in science, or make-believe?  This just seems like an easy answer to me.  ;)]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I stop checking here for a couple days and a half a dozen new posts pop up :)

Mystic, I don't think that saying I have observed intelligence is the same at all as saying I have observed magic.  For example, the entire purpose of SETI is to look for signals that show signs of being created by intelligence, rather than natural sources.

SETI is probably a good parallel to ID in some ways.  The 'hypothesis' that their is intelligent life in the universe besided us is probably non-falsifiable.  The study of what intelligence would look like, how we could discern intelligence, and what methods we can find intelligence are all valid scientific lines of inquiry.

Similarly, ID as a whole is non-falisifiable, but saying that X is what intelligence interfering with out evolution would look like and here is X is both scientific and falsifiable.  Indeed, in a couple of cases the ID claims of X have been falsified.

Regardless of whether you think the chance of their being intelligent influence on our history as 1% or 0% I think that looking closely at those unexplained leaps in evolution is very worthy of all scientists.  I expect that we will learn more about evolution and in the end they will not reveal any signs of intelligence.  To say that that is known for sure though has nothing to do with science.

I agree that our use of the word theory causes problems.  In general, society is far to cavalier about theory denying it the respect that it deserves.  I do think though that scientists can sometimes be far to invested in particular theories, and take them as fact when they are not.  It is not foolishness to remember that just because a theory explains things and is useful it can still be completely wrong.  Newton was almost right about the what, and his theories explained things and were useful, but when it comes down to it, he was completely wrong about the why.  I expect that pretty much every theory we hold today will turn out to be wrong.  Some like Newton's will remain useful and good descriptions, others will turn out to be completely the wrong direction.

I don't think anyone can say honestly that they base their truth on reality and facts.  We don't know all of the 'facts' so the best we can say is the we see dimly what reality is.  One of the fun things about Quantum Physics, from the little I understand of it, is that our 'reality' may be a lot more ephermal than we like to think.  All of sciense is based upon some 'unproven' postulates.  From that philosophical perspective at least, it is no more 'true' than any of the worlds religions, which takes us back to the start of this thread like a snake biting it's tail.

A few days ago I &lt;a href=&quot;http://davejustus.blogspot.com/2005/11/scott-adams-on-id.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; this &lt;a href=&quot;http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2005/11/intelligent_des.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Scott Adams take on the ID debate&lt;/a&gt;.  I think I am in pretty much the exact same camp as him, and would be interested to see where you guys think he went wrong.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[It would seem that Mr. Adams (no relation) is saying what I have been trying to say here, but apparently with more eloquence.  To respond to Mystic, I'm not trying to debate the nature of reality and truth (that's a way bigger topic!).  I'm saying, like Mr. Adams, the evolutionists may have it wrong, and to teach that they have it right is not only a disservice to our future generations, it is plain fallacious.  To ram the fossil record (and remember, without transitional forms or biological evidence of positive mutation) down people's throats as being the only answer is poor education as we say to our children that just because most people believe something it must therefore be true.  It falls under Appealing to Popularity by saying, &quot;Most people believe in evolution, so it must be true.&quot;  Teach our kids that evolution in a theory of the origin of the species, give them the evidence for it, give them the evidence against it, and that will better show them critical thinking skills than telling them it's true, &quot;so there, now let's move on to the Second Law of Thermodynamics and skip the part that helps weaken the evolutionists argument, okay kids?&quot;

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[&quot;&lt;em&gt;Well, I wouldn't call the Webster's Dictionary a second-hand tool at word definition.&lt;/em&gt;&quot;

As far as common usage, I am sure that Websters does a fine job. And I am sure that websters has a industrial jargon lexicon as well. The general usage book might not regflect the specific usage in a industry, however.

This is the case here. In science, as I pointed out, Theory has a very specific meaning. If we are going off of diffrent definitions of a word, then we will never have common ground.

To say that ID is a scientific theory is to state that it has &quot;&lt;em&gt;an explanation or model that covers a substantial group of occurrences in nature and has been confirmed by a substantial number of experiments and observations.&lt;/em&gt;&quot;.

I for one, would like to see the observations that support ID.

I have seen the observations that support Evolution. They make logical sense to me. Do we know every little thing about it? No. Is there room for more? Yes. Is 'spooky &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_at_a_distance_%28physics%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;action at a distance&lt;/a&gt;' a part of it? Highly unlikely.

In the search for truth, you start with the possible, and keep ruleing it out. When you have nothing left, then the impossible must be true. To start with the impossible, and unproveable, derails the entire process. It returns us to cave men, scared of the lighting in the sky.

We must teach our kids about scientific process. We must teach them to think. We must teach them how to compete on a global scale. Teaching Metaphysics as science does not seem to me a good idea. Changing the definition of science to fit your metaphysics and then teaching it does not seem like a good idea either.

The onus is on the ID supporters. They brought the  idea to the table. Now they need to bring the proof. I have not seen any proof, or even any evidence.

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Tsykoduk,

I would guess, that like me you are not enough of a biologist to evaluate the individual claims of ID proponants, like me you probably have to rely on other expects to do so.  I have seen some refutations of some specific ID claims that were very convincing.  I have also seen ad hominem attacks and refusal to address the claims at all by these experts.  It seems to me that you take that as evidence that these claims have to merit, if they were serious or deserving of consideration scientists would address them seriously, right?

I don't have that much faith in scientists.  I believe that like the rest of us they can , and do, engage in mob mentality.  This year the Nobel Prize for Medicine was one by scientists who had shown that ulcers were caused by a virus, rather than stress as had been previously believed.  For years they were ignored and denigrated for their theory of ulcer causation.  Their evidence was strong, but they were essencially denied a hearing.

ID propanents it seems to me make statements like:  This is how we can know if intelligence was a part of development, and here is an example of when that happened.

The scientific establishment responds:  Intelligence being part of development is impossible, end of discussion.

They don't address if the criteria used to determine intelligence is correct or not and they don't then demonstrate why, if the criteria were correct the example doesn't fit that criteria, they dismiss the idea as impossible to begin with.

Regardless of how true or correct ID is, I don't believe that those who oppose it, from what I have seen of the debate anyway, are engaging in a scientific way.

I will also point out that 'spooky actions at a distance' are not a part of ID.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;SETI is probably a good parallel to ID in some ways. The 'hypothesis' that their is intelligent life in the universe besided us is probably non-falsifiable. - Dave Justus&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Yes, but SETI is attempting to prove their belief by finding evidence, they are not trying to add alien intelligence as a fact to our children's science books.

&lt;blockquote&gt;I'm saying, like Mr. Adams, the evolutionists may have it wrong, - Obidavekenobi&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;What you have instead is each side misrepresenting the other's position and then making a good argument for why the misrepresentation is wrong...

...My fallback position in situations like this has always been to trust the experts , the scientists , of which more than 90%+ are sure that Darwin got it right...

...I'd be surprised if 90%+ of scientists are wrong about the evidence for Darwinism... - Scott Adams&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Which article were you reading of Mr. Adams?  It would appear that he does not favor ID at all.  In fact, in &lt;a href=&quot;â€http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2005/11/intelligent_des_1.htmlâ€&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;a later article&lt;/a&gt; by Mr. Adams he states that,

&lt;blockquote&gt;For the record, if you put a gun to my head and make me choose, I'll pick Darwin's version over Intelligent Design, although I am rooting for the alien seedling theory most of all. - Scott Adams&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  He did say that there is always a possibility that scientists are wrong about evolution, but heck, there's also a possibility that the &lt;a&gt;Flying Spaghetti Monster and a Galactic Chicken&lt;/a&gt; are real too. ;)

&lt;blockquote&gt;This year the Nobel Prize for Medicine was one by scientists who had shown that ulcers were caused by a virus, rather than stress as had been previously believed. For years they were ignored and denigrated for their theory of ulcer causation. Their evidence was strong, but they were essencially denied a hearing. - Dave Justus&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It certainly is not easy getting new scientific theories proved, but the point here is that they persevered and had the evidence to back up their claims.  In the end, they proved their statements and won the day.  Must we continue stating that there is zero proof to the claim ID followers are trying to make?

I'm no biologist either (although that was my major years ago), but I have studied enough evidence on both sides of this argument to know there are years of evidence on the side of evolution, and none on the side of ID even though technically the ID folks should have at least something to show for the amount of time they have been searching by now.  Common sense tells me that just maybe there is nothing there and that is why they have not found anything yet.

I don't mind if they keep searching, like SETI is doing, and when they find something, come back and we'll take a look at it at that time and decide if it holds up to scrutiny.  Not before.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I, for one, would like to see the experiments (repeatedly demonstrable) that prove evolution.  The evolutionists are missing pieces of the puzzle, just like ID folks.  Who has more or less marbles in their evidence bag does not mean someone is  exclusively right.

I never said I, or Mr. Adams, agree with the ID camp.  I'm saying I, and Mr. Adams, are saying we agree insofar that both sides still have some work to do to prove themselves.  Whether or not one side is ahead of the other in meeting their burden of proof makes no difference to me &quot;if someone holds a gun to my head.&quot;

What I am saying (I must need to clarify) is to push evolution in schools as the only explanation, physical or metaphysical, is irresponsible and morally wrong.  Tsykoduk started this post because he was concerned about the Kansas BoE issue.  I am concerned, too.  Unlike you other guys (I think) I have children in high school.  This is a very real issue to me.  My kids and I discuss it.  I put my money where my mouth is with them and honestly say, &quot;Kids, I don't know the answer.  Here's what some other people who know more than I do say about the issue...&quot;

Perhaps someday we may have the technology to do such things and make evoltion happen in a petri dish.  For now we have some leftover evidences of forms that once existed, but do no longer exist, and bear sembalance to forms that currently reside on planet Earth.  This does not a foolproof causal connection make, nor should it be taught so.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I would posit that the ID camp has 0 evidence. Can they point to &lt;strong&gt;anything&lt;/strong&gt; and say &quot;See? that's the Watchmaker at work!&quot;.

Nope.

The reason that Evolution is accepted is it has withstood some very serious scrutiny.

On to the question of Evidence:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In biology, evolution is the process by which populations of organisms acquire and pass on novel traits from generation to generation, affecting the overall makeup of the population and even leading to the emergence of new species.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

--&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_evolution&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; (yup, you guessed it)

So, to find evidence that evolution works, we have to find places where &quot;&lt;em&gt;populations of organisms acquire and pass on novel traits from generation to generation, affecting the overall makeup of the population&lt;/em&gt;&quot;.

Let's start small. Enter an island chain, cut off from everything else for a long time. Yep, the Galapagos.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Each island of the Galapagos that Darwin visited had its own kind of finch (14 in all), found nowhere else in the world. Some had beaks adapted for eating large seeds, others for small seeds, some had parrot-like beaks for feeding on buds and fruits, and some had slender beaks for feeding on small insects (see Figure 5). One used a thorn to probe for insect larvae in wood, like some woodpeckers do. (Six were ground-dwellers, and eight were tree finches.) (This diversification into different ecological roles, or niches, is thought to be necessary to permit the coexistence of multiple species, a topic we will examined in a later lecture.) To Darwin, it appeared that each was slightly modified from an original colonist, probably the finch on the mainland of South America, some 600 miles to the east. It is probable that adaptive radiation led to the formation of so many species because other birds were few or absent, leaving empty niches to fill; and because the numerous islands of the Galapagos provided ample opportunity for geographic isolation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

-- &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.globalchange.umich.edu/globalchange1/current/lectures/selection/selection.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Evolution and Natural Selection&lt;/a&gt;

Now, you could just say that 'God Made It That Way'. That's possible. It could have happened. However, we have good evidence that Natural Selection happens. We have no good evidence that 'Bang, God Said it and It Happened'. Nor even that there was some 'watchmaker'.

Science is predicated on logic, fact and reason. There is no fact behind the ID theory.

I have never said that Evolution should be the only thing taught. Evolution should be taught as a science - &lt;em&gt;that's what it is&lt;/em&gt;. ID should be taught as Metaphysics. Would priests like it if I demanded that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0553380168/102-3432861-9911340?v=glance&amp;amp;n=283155&amp;amp;v=glance&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;A Brief History of Time&lt;/a&gt; be taught in sunday school? Or how about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.users.drew.edu/%7Ejlenz/whynot.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Why I Am Not A Christian&lt;/a&gt;?

If ID wants to be treated like a scientific theory, it has to meet the expectations of that. If it's hard, so what. That's life. The good things are not easy to achieve.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[ID proponants do not deny evolution.  Indeed ID relies upon it.

That is one place where the arguement is distorted.  The fact that evolution has lots of data to back it up is irrelevant.  No one who is serious about science disputes evolution.

Mystic, I think you misread Adams essay at least as badly as ObiDave did.  Yes, Adams (like myself) finds ID unlikely.  The point of the essay was that those who are arguing against it are not doing so in a correct, or a scientific manner.

To return to the SETI parralel, we talked about SETI in science at my school.  We talked about how we are looking for intelligence in the stars and, to a lesser extent because it is comple, how we would be able to tell intelligence from natural events.

What is wrong with looking for intelligence in our past, and discussing that search and how we would tell intelligence from natural events in a science class?]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[As far as SETI, there is a stastical probility that intellegent life exists in the universe. Infact, given the observable size of the universe, there is a very high probility that it cannot not exist. :)

Looking for a watchmaker who did the hard things that we do not understand at this time - there is no evidence (statistical, emperical, logical or otherwise) to support that claim.

If ID were mentioned as an aside (We know that evoluition happened, however there are some gaps in our knoledge. Some feel that a Intellegent Designer was responsible for those gaps, some feel that our knoledge is simply not complete) that &lt;strong&gt;might&lt;/strong&gt; be ok. But it's not a theory.

I think that folks forget the probablities involved here. So, let's take a look at them.

One of the ID articles that I linked to gave a 1 million to 1 chance of life occuring.

So, enter &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation&quot;&gt;Drake's Equation&lt;/a&gt; (modified, as we do not care about communicating civilations)

N = N* fp ne fl fi

Current estimates put these in

N* = 100,00,000,000 (Number of stars in the galaxy)
fp = 20% (low estimate) (Number of stars w/ plantary systems)
ne = .1 (they say 1 to 5, but I think that's too high) (number of earth like  planets in each planetary system)
fl=let's give this the 1 in 1 million. So .00001 (chances of life)
fi= let's give this 50%. I think that intellegnce is a survival trait. (chance of intellegence developing)

So, doing the math, we have 1000 planets with life in this galaxy. Include the 100 billion galaxys in the observable universe... well, you get the picture.

Each one is looking up, and wondering the same thing that we are.

Coming full circle, it all comes down to evidence. We have statistical evidence that (even with million to one odds) life will develop on it's own. Logically, adding in a third party is adding another layer of complexity to the question. One that is simply not needed.

If good evidence is found for tampering by intellegence in our past, then we should explore it. However to look at it just because some people think that it makes sense is not science. It's mythology.

To float the question, what is wrong with teaching FSMism? They have just as much evidence as ID. Infact, if ID is taught, I would say that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.venganza.org/&quot;&gt;FSMism&lt;/a&gt; should be taught in science class. And American Indian creationism, and Christian creationism, etc.

Why do people get so upset when science makes a new idea conform to the rules of science? Well, they really do not. Unless religion is involved. I know that IDers claim that Religion is not involved - but it really is.Intellegent design. Come on. It's creationism re-writ for the current understanding of the history of earth.]]></wp:comment_content>

Because IT IS NOT SCIENCE.   (tap, tap, tap...) &quot;Is this thing on?&quot;  ;)

Once ID folks actually find evidence of ID, THEN it should be included in a science class.  Of course, even then it would not be science, it would be something else.  We would probably then have to have an ID class.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[tykoduk,

Is any of that stuff falsifiable?

I don't think so.

Mystic,

SETI is not science by some strict definitions either.  Do you oppose discussing SETI in highschools?

SETI is speculation, hope, and a search with unknown chances of success.  ID is the same.  At it's heart, I think that is what science is also.  The dream of finding something, the lure of the unknown (and yes, even the unknowable) is what drives science.

In my mind, those who oppose teaching this are not motivated as much by a love for science, as they are for a hatred of the idea that this might comfort people who have a religious view of the world.  One can think about ID without being religious, and I think religions are mistaken in thinking ID supports their worldview (it does not in my opinion) but the fact that religious people like it is what makes you hate it.

Christians don't especially embrace SETI, so that is ok.  Many Christians embrace ID, so it is not.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Da Duk and I were discussing whether or not it would be ok to discuss SETI in science class and not ID.  Personally I agree that SETI is essentially in the same boat with ID and really does not have much place in a science class.

The Tsyko disagrees as I'm sure he'll comment on next.  :)

Even though SETI and ID are trying to use scientific methods to prove their search is based on some sort of reality, neither one has yet to bring anything to the table to back up their claim.

Until that day, both SETI and ID are still searching for acceptance by the scientific community as a whole.  Neither have achieved that distinction yet.

&lt;blockquote&gt;In my mind, those who oppose teaching this are not motivated as much by a love for science, as they are for a hatred of the idea that this might comfort people who have a religious view of the world. - Dave Justus&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Neither love nor hatred motivate my opinion on this topic.  I am motivated, as I have always been, by truth and reality.

I like a good fantasy as much as the next guy, but not when it comes to teaching it as factual in my children's school.

Personally, if someone finds comfort in believing in ID more power to them.  I am not against religion or its teachings, and I don't give one iota of concern about those who want to believe that some super being with a cosmic erector set built our planet.

You can say all you want to that you can think ID can also be approached as not being tied into religion, but if ID is claiming that biology has been manufactured somehow, then the engineer behind such a colossal feet could only be godlike when compared to us.

Evolution, on the other hand, can easily slip into many religions without making too much of a ripple on the surface.  Who cares if some points conflict with the religious teachings, how would that be any different then many religions already are? :)]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Falsifiability =/= Science.

The very statement that all science must be falsifiable is a non-falsifiable statement, therefor, if you use it as a litmus test for 'real science' it fails itself.

Falsifiablity is a part of measuring a theory - but it's not the be all or end all. For example, say that I can produce a million dollar bill. Before I produce it, the theory 'Tsykoduk can produce a million dollar bill' cannot be falsified. However, if I were to produce it, the theory that I can produce a million dollar bill is true. If I do not produce it, then we will not give much credence to that theory.

ID is in that boat exactly. They have made some big claims. When they are asked for their evidence, they dodge the question or use the gaps in our current understanding as evidence.

In my using of Drake's equation, I used the chances for life to spring forth that ID'ers have quoted, and that I referenced in an earlier post. Even if it were a billion to one it still works. A hundred billion to one works. It's just statistical evidence. Not empirical (of course), but evidence non the less.

Every time that I have asked for ID's evidence, I have gotten no response. You cannot posit a scientific theory with out any evidence. That would be a religious theory. :)]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[This seems timely to Tsykoduk's continuing string here on his blog.  It is a news article from the AP posted today on CNN.com:


LAWRENCE, Kansas (AP) -- Creationism and intelligent design are going to be studied at the University of Kansas, but not in the way advocated by opponents of the theory of evolution.

A course being offered next semester by the university religious studies department is titled &quot;Special Topics in Religion: Intelligent Design, Creationism and other Religious Mythologies.&quot;

&quot;The KU faculty has had enough,&quot; said Paul Mirecki, department chairman.

&quot;Creationism is mythology,&quot; Mirecki said. &quot;Intelligent design is mythology. It's not science. They try to make it sound like science. It clearly is not.&quot;

Earlier this month, the state Board of Education adopted new science teaching standards that treat evolution as a flawed theory, defying the view of science groups.

Although local school boards still decide how science is taught in the classrooms, the vote was seen as a major victory for proponents of intelligent design, which says that the universe is so complex that it must have been created by a higher power.

Critics say intelligent design is merely creationism -- a literal reading of the Bible's story of creation as the handiwork of God -- camouflaged in scientific language as a way to get around court rulings that creationism injects religion into public schools.

John Calvert, an attorney and managing director of the Intelligent Design Network in Johnson County, Kansas, said Mirecki will go down in history as a laughingstock.

&quot;To equate intelligent design to mythology is really an absurdity, and it's just another example of labeling anybody who proposes [intelligent design] to be simply a religious nut,&quot; Calvert said. &quot;That's the reason for this little charade.&quot;

Mirecki said his course, limited to 120 students, would explore intelligent design as a modern American mythology. Several faculty members have volunteered to be guest lecturers, he said.

University Chancellor Robert Hemenway said Monday he didn't know all the details about the new course.

&quot;If it's a course that's being offered in a serious and intellectually honest way, those are the kind of courses a university frequently offers,&quot; he said.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I disagree that I missed the boat on Mr. Adams' article.  I got a point from it that he does actually make (one of several).  What has been equally interesting has been reading  posts to his site behind his initial post.  They run in many of the same directions the posts here on Tsykoduk's site are going.  Hot topic...lots of views.

I think SETI is a great idea.  I'm all for it.  I think if we ever did find evidence of intelligent life in the universe outside Earth (assuming we ourvselves count as &quot;intelligent&quot; ;) ) it would go a long way to uniting our world into a more peaceful place.  Peace is good...I hope we can all agree on THAT at least!]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Peace Sucks!

Hehe

It is nice to see Tsykoduk finally admit that falsifiability isn't the beginning and the end of science.

As to some of the specifics with SETI, the Drake equation is not, in my opinion, Science at all, although it is a useful to play with.  Where there is science in SETI is theories on how to differentiate random patterns from intelligence based patterns.  Obviously methods to detect patterns and radiations from deep space is also science, although SETI is probably not the driver of that science.

That remains my fundamental point.  I think it is science to create a hypothesis and eventually theories on how to tell the difference between intelligent and natural occurances.  We do it with SETI, We are trying to do it with ID, and we do it all the time in Archeology and Anthropology.  Obviously, that last is much easier because we are limiting our exploration to human intelligence and activities, which we know a great deal about.

I don't find ID to be any more or less tied to religion that evolution.  I could easily fit in atheism to ID, particularly since it is pretty obvious that if ID is true, the number of direct changes to our evolution is limited.  As far as the biology goes, we could do it ourselves (getting somewhere to do it and having the patience to keep on the project for a billion years or so is another matter, but certainly doesn't take Godlike intelligence)

Indeed, ID seems to me to be much harder to reconcile to the major religions than evolution is.  A God who was as clumsy as the designer of ID doesn't fit at all with the Supreme being meme.  Evolution is dramatically more elegant.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I might buy off on ID possibly fitting into Evolution.

In-other-words, it's always possible that someone manipulated our planets natural evolution by either &quot;planting&quot; us or doing some other sort of manipulative experiment.  Where I won't capitulate is that someone created the Earth from scratch.  I'm a firm believer in the natural order of things.

It's important for me to point out, that even though I believe in the possibility that some sort of ID could have affected our natural progression, I am not going to join in the ID drum beating until that time in which someone uncovers the secret underground laboratory the engineer's used, or whatever the source of this so-called Intelligent Design.

Until the time proof of ID is revealed, I hold the more plausible truth that our science to date has shown us, that adaptation and evolution has occurred, is occurring now, and will continue in our future.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;As far as the biology goes, we could do it ourselves&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At this time, no we could not.

ID is tied to religion. Inherent in it is a belief in a God/Godhead. After all, if ID is correct and life could not evolve out of non-life, then the Alien theory is right out of the window as well. After all, who ID'ed them? After enough layers, we get to the beginning of the universe, and things get quite dicey.

ID has to have a supernatural explanation. That explanation also fails the first cause logic as well, but that is another story...

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[ID and Evolution are both very weak at dealing with the origin of life.  When it boils down to it, both views say there was not life, and then the magic happened and there was life.

At least ID has some explanation for the magic, however poor.

While some ID proponants make an absolute claim that life cannot naturally spontaneously appear from non-life, most limit their criticism to life on earth.  If we want to play around with the Alien concept, we would also have to realize that conditions for our hypothetical aliens could have been radically different.  Without knowing the history of our hypothetical designer it is impossible to know if the criticisms of the ID crowd would be relevant to that as well.

If we want a supernatural (and hence extra-universal) designer, then all speculation pretty much is futile as we don't even know what natural laws would govern such a place.

However, we could introduce life to an unliving world and channel it's development.  We wouldn't have to worry about spontaneous generation as there is already plenty of life that we could use as a starter.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[So, let me get this straight. Life could not have formed on Earth, because it's to complex. However, some other place, life could have formed on it's own, because?

That makes no sense at all.

If Life is to complex to have formed on earth, what makes some other place more special? We cannot assume that 'some where out there' is all that different from our experiences.

If we could use that logic, I could state that Dragons roam an alternate earth. I know this because we do not understand why dragons do not exist, therefore they must exist. However I cannot see them, so they must exist 'some where else'.

If life could self-generate elsewhere, then it could here. fantasizing about some mystical realm where the laws of physics, biology and statistics work differently is no more then a day-dream - until we find such a place.

I would chalk that up to Magic as well.

As far as magic goes... Evolution does not posit magic. It comes out and says: We don't know this yet. Lack of knowledge =/= belief in magic. Lack of knowledge == a thirst to find out (at least for me).

Just because we do not understand something does not make it magic. I would hope that we have gotten beyond that. I see a computer CPU humming along - I understand what it does, but not how. Does that make it magic?]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[As I said, I don't think either theory offers us much about the origin of life.

However, the idea that earth life (all of the life we have so far observerd) could not self generate does not automatically mean that other forms of life could not self generate.  I am not going to say that it did, I don't particularly believe that, but it is not internally contradictory as you make it sound.  It would not be the 'place' that is necessarily special, it could be the 'life' in question.  Obviously the conditions for a non-carbon based life form, for example, would be dramatically different than our own.

Let me repeat that I am not advocating this position.

As far as Dragons go, some of the implications of quatum mechanics do indeed imply alternate Earths and that all possibilities do indeed exists somewhere.  I don't claim to even begin to understand the how or why of that though :)

Lastly, I have my suspicians about CPUs being magic (demonic in fact) and that their primary purpose is to generate evil (in particular large amounts of cursing.)]]></wp:comment_content>

In our line of work we often refer to some machines as being &lt;em&gt;possessed&lt;/em&gt;. :)

It's interesting how we debate about human life being so special on this planet when we only reside on a very small portion of the Earth.

I wonder what the creatures that live in the oceans think of us arrogant humans?]]></wp:comment_content>

Update: The <span class="caps">USMC</span>'s Birthday was yesterday (November 10th), however today is Veterans day in the US - A time to remember all those who helped and help us stay free.

<title>Week 8: The Zen of Woodpiles</title>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, yesterday I moved about 2 or 3 cords of wood from point A in my yard to point B and C (made two piles). I was doing a lot of thinking during the task. When we started it was snowing and windy. By the time we ended, it was raining and windy.</p>


	<p>ick.</p>


	<p>I learned a lot about the meaning of Zen today.</p>


	<p>The ground was slippery, muddy. Our grass has not come back in after the trees were removed and the fence installed, so it's patchy, slippery and rough. Each step was a challenge. Each step took concentration. Each step took focus.</p>


	<p>Zen is like that. Each step of each thing that we do should demand our total attention. Zen is simply paying attention.</p>


<blockquote>We owe so much money we're not broke we're broken
We're so poor we can't even pay attention
So what do you want
You want to be famous and rich and happy
But you're terrified you have nothing to offer this world
Nothing to say and no way to say it</blockquote>
-<a href="http://www.kmfdm.net"><span class="caps">KMFDM</span></a> (<a href="http://www.kmfdm.net/lyrics/dogma.htm">Dogma</a>)

	<p>Simply paying attention to our daily lives, each step of what we do, the fleeting feelings that invade our thoughts is a very liberating feeling.</p>


	<p>At first it's a concious choice - that is where I am today - but sooner or later it will become a habit. It's odd, as I type this, I can feel the keystrokes on each finger indvidually. Paying attention.</p>


	<p>As we learn to pay attention, we can start to pay attention to more and more of what we are doing and what is going on around us at once. It's a way of interacting with the physical universe on a more viceral level. It's a way of always making sure that what you are doing is the best that you can.</p>


	<p>Zen is another word for Mindfulness. We should aspire to be mindful of our actions, pay attention to our deeds, and do the best we can at each thing that we do.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Will I be struck for saying, &quot;Um, duh?&quot;

That doesn't mean hybrids aren't worth the investment in the long-term. The way I see it, everyone who buys and/or supports hybrids NOW is helpin (hopefully) to convince manufacturers that people want these cars. Which will lead manufacturers to seek ways to make hybrids for less. Which will bring the price down, one would hope.

My miniscule optimistic side shows at the weirdest times.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Yeah... but there are better choice then hybrids that reduce oil consumption and are cleaner. That's my point. It's cheaper to run biofuels then have a high tech battery pack system to help you ecomomy.

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[More signifigantly, a good portion of a hybrid vehicles fuel efficiency has nothing to do with the fact that it is a hybrid.

Hybrids have every trick we know to increase fuel efficiency no matter how expensive added on to them.  They only sell because they are environmentally hip.

Part of the 'hipness' of hybrids is that they are more expensive and represent a sacrifice for the greater good and allow the purchasers to feel like environmental martyrs.  Therefore, I doubt that we will see the price decrease even if it is possible.]]></wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the three people on the moon who have not heard about <a href="http://www.sonybmg.com/">Sony</a>'s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rootkit">RootKit</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management"><span class="caps">DRM</span></a> program, here is the scoop.</p>


	<p>Sony/BMG has put some software on their music CD's which modify how Windows (and attempt to modify how Mac <span class="caps">OSX</span>) works at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_%28computer_science%29">kernel</a> or core level. This is a '<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_thing">Bad Thingâ„¢</a>'.</p>


	<p>A rootkit is a program that takes over your computer, hides it's self and does what ever it wants to. In this case, it stops you from copying the music off of the CD. The problem is that it basically makes it's self 'root' or supreme commander of your computer. All rights to do anything that it wants.</p>


	<p>Shame on you Sony.</p>


<blockquote>Microsoft, Symatec, McAffee and some others were aware of the Sony rootkit months ago. They either turned a blind eye or actively helped Sony 'hideâ€ their little present deep into your Windows system</blockquote>
-<a href="http://lobby4linux.com/WordPress/?p=58">helios</a>

	<p>Hey, That's Great. So the people that some of us trust to write our OS's and the security software to protect that OS are implicated in creating a custom rootkit for a third party. That's like Ford helping out car theives.</p>


	<p>I certainly hope that people everywhere take notice of this. Your computer running Windows is not yours - according to Microsoft, Sony and the other fat cats. You should have no control over it, they say. I say - <a href="http://www.transbuddha.com/mediaHolder.php?id=174">switch</a>. <a href="http://www.apple.com/switch/">Switch</a> quick.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>In January 1982, President Ronald Reagan approved a <span class="caps">CIA</span> plan to sabotage the economy of the Soviet Union through covert transfers of technology that contained hidden malfunctions, including software that later triggered a huge explosion in a Siberian natural gas pipeline, according to a new memoir by a Reagan White House official.</blockquote>

	<p>-<a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4394002"><span class="caps">MSNBC</span></a>, via <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2005/11/cold_war_softwa.html">Schneier on Security</a></p>


	<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Security">Computer security</a> is a hobby/profession of mine. I have been worried for a long time about the possibility of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberterrorism">cyber-terrorist</a> attack, or even a conventional attack aimed at large scale economic disruption. This is the 'proof in the pudding' that such a thing can happen, and has happened already.</p>


	<p>To use <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows">insecure</a> systems in such a world for our critical infrastructure should be criminal. If a major flaw in Windows were uncovered and used to attack the US's banking industry - how much damage could be done? How many billions of dollars could be simply erased?</p>


	<p>Computer systems are no longer just for email and word processing. Businesses live and die by their systems. Their entire accounting ledger is on a computer now.</p>


	<p>Imagine, if you will, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rootkit">rootkit</a> like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_worm">worm</a> that would simple shred any Quick Books files that it found. Or one that scrambles the <span class="caps">BIOS</span> of the computer so that it will not boot. Or one that overwrites the allocation tables on the Hard Drive to trash the entire thing. You would want to make sure that it could propagate, so have it wait to do anything until it infects four other machines, or 6 hours pass.</p>


	<p>That's the kind of thing that keeps me awake at night.</p>


	<p>An, we still run out in droves to buy products that are proven time and time again to be totally inadequate to the task. Worse then that, we run our businesses and governments on these products. We listen to the <a href="http://www.templetons.com/brad/billg.html">people</a> who make, sell and profit from these products as they tell us how secure they are - how they are working hard to fix the problems that they themselves have created.</p>


	<p>And we give them our money, and they get richer.</p>


	<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberwar">Cyberwar</a> is already here. The first battles in this new realm were fought over 20 years ago. It's only time before we are hit again.</p>


	<p>Do you think that we are ready?</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>Exploit code for a critical flaw in fully patched versions of Microsoft Corp.'s Internet Explorer browser has been released on the Internet, putting millions of Web surfers at risk of computer hijack attacks.

	<p>The zero-day exploit, posted by a U.K.-based group called "Computer Terrorism," could allow a remote hacker to take complete control of a Windows system if the victim simply browses to a malicious Web site.</p>


	<p>Ziff Davis Internet News have verified that the exploit works on fully patched Windows XP systems with default IE installations...</p>


	<p>...The group that published the exploit said Microsoft has been aware of the Javascript Window() vulnerability for several months but was mistakenly treating it as a low-priority denial-of-service flaw.</p>


	<p>Benjamin Tobias Franz, a German security researcher, originally published an advisory in May this year to warn of the denial-of-service bug.</blockquote></p>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[&quot;Switching to alternative energy now is a win win situation.&quot;

No it isn't.  It is a major economic loss situation because oil is still the cheapest form of energy we have.

&quot;Market forces will not be able to fix the problem with out great pain.&quot;

True to an extent, if the problem that they allege exists (which I have my doubts) then NOTHING will fix it without pain.  Market forces will remain the most effective means of finding the most economically viable supply of energy however.  Of course Political forces (excessive regulations, anti-nuclear paranoia) may hamper market forces in doing this.  Obviously market forces need to be contrained to deal with neighborhood effects, and political forces are appropriate for that, but politics that ignores the market is doomed to failure.

&quot;The longer we wait, the worse it'g going to be.&quot;

This may be true if we wait to research alternatives, but it is certainly not true that it will be worse if we impliment more expensive alternatives now.  There are tremendous oil reserves left, although much of it is more difficult (expensive) to extract (oil shale and tar sands) and panicing that oil will disappear or that peak production is just around the corner is almost certainly needless doom-saying.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Win #1

By starting right now to switch to alternitve energy sorces, we have cleaner burning fuels and power.

Win #2

When peak oil happens - when ever it happens, we will already be totally ready.

Market Forces:

This is where I leave my liberiatiran freinds behind. Market forces are concerned about one thing - increasing their bottom line. If they have a resource that is becoming more and more scarce, a resource that the majority of the people and industry is locked into, they will start to charge more and more. It's not in the market's best intrest to switch to cheaper, greener power production.

Waiting:

I am talking about researching. I do not think that we will switch to biofuels tomorrow. However, we need to make the choice at least avaible. Right now, as a consumer in spokane, if I want to run biodiesel in my truck either I have to make it my self, or I have to go to one station way out in the valley between 8 and 5, M - F.

It's not a choice until it's avaible. It will not be avaible until there is a market demand for it.

I'm not advocating pumping billions into the research - just tax breaks. No taxes on biofuels. That would be quite the incentive to get it to market.

Like roads, there must be an inital investment to bootstrap these things. We can either wait until the markets stop raking in record profits off the price of oil, or we can start to do something now.

As far as these huge reserves - who is telling us this? The Oil Companies? it would seem to me that they have a vested intrest in keeping prices high, and supply low. When the entire world is starving for oil, and it's going for a $1,000 a barrel, they will be where they want to be. Can we really trust them?]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Alternative to Oil does not of course automatically equal cleaner burning.  I expect that any solution to our energy needs will have environmental consequences.  Obviously these consequences should be taken into consideration as best as possible and either regulation or taxation inacted to offset the costs incurred.  While one can argue that that isn't being correctly done for oil, I would argue that it is even less correctly done for bio-fuel, for example.

Peak Oil will almost certainly happen immediately if after alternative solutions are put in place.  When we no longer need oil the production will drop.  We can choose to mandate this by forcing a switch to alternative energy sources before it makes economic sense, or we can let it happen naturally when other options become cheaper than oil (through a combination of improved technologies and rising oil prices.)

There are more forces in the market than oil companies.  If someone can supply energy cheaper and in a usable format, switching will happen regardless of what oil companies want.  Obviously there are 'conversion costs' to be overcome, but those costs should be part of the overall equation of when it is effective to transfer energy sources.  Of course it is also true that despite the claims of the commercial you linked to, oil companies are in fact heavily interested and actively taking part in alternative fuel research and development.

I have nothing against research.  I advocate it myself, and I think that there are reasons for Government involvement in such a thing.  I question the need for 'tax breaks' for biofuels for example.  Certainly if it can be shown that biofuels cost less neighborhood effects than fossil fuel that could be a factor for reduced taxes, but I don't think a biofueled vehicle requires less highway infrastructure that a fossil fuel vehicle (for example) and therefore the taxes for that neighborhood effect should be the same for both.  Making one choice artificially more attractive than another is disasterous economic policy.

From an environmental point of view, I am much more concerned with pestacide runoff and topsoil erosion than I am with CO2 emissions.

Lastly, I don't think there is any doubt at all that vast amounts of fossil fuels are availible.  The U.S. has massive coal deposits and the existence, composition and extent of oil shale and tar sands are not, so far as I know, in dispute.  There are questions about extraction costs, profitability at 40-45 dollars a barrel are numbers I have seen frequently tossed around, and obviously unless/until oil prices have a bottom estimate of that long term the capital investments to achieve that won't be made.  Certainly though I don't think anyone would dispute that these resources can be extracted far far below $1000 a barrel.  Even pessimistic estimates would put a ceiling on long term oil prices at $100 a barrel.  My guess is that we are unlikely to see oil prices sustained at above $75 a barrel (adjusted for inflation of course) in our lifetimes.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[It would appear that the class won't be taught, after all...from the AP:

TOPEKA, Kansas (AP) -- A University of Kansas course devoted to debunking creationism and intelligent design has been canceled after the professor who planned to teach it caused a furor by sending an e-mail mocking Christian fundamentalists.

Twenty-five students had enrolled in the course, originally called &quot;Special Topics in Religion: Intelligent Design, Creationism and Other Religious Mythologies,&quot; which had been scheduled for the spring.

Critics of intelligent design say it is merely creationism -- a literal reading of the Bible's story of creation -- camouflaged in scientific language.

Professor Paul Mirecki, chairman of religious studies, canceled the class Wednesday, the university said.

Mirecki recently sent an e-mail to members of a student organization in which he referred to religious conservatives as &quot;fundies&quot; and said a course depicting intelligent design as mythology would be a &quot;nice slap in their big fat face.&quot;

He later apologized, and did so again Thursday in a statement issued by the university.

&quot;I made a mistake in not leading by example, in this student organization e-mail forum, the importance of discussing differing viewpoints in a civil and respectful manner,&quot; he said.

Chancellor Robert Hemenway said Mirecki's comments were &quot;repugnant and vile.&quot;

&quot;It misrepresents everything the university is to stand for,&quot; Hemenway said.

The class was added to the curriculum after the Kansas Board of Education decided recently to include more criticism of evolution in science standards for public school students.

State Sen. Kay O'Connor, a Mirecki critic, said the university did the right thing.

&quot;I'm glad they decided to listen to the public. The public response was so negative because of what seemed to be so hateful coming from the KU professor,&quot; said O'Connor, a Republican. &quot;I am critical of his hatefulness toward Christians.&quot;]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I would think that the class's curriculum should be examined, and another teacher appointed to teach it.

It really saddens me when stuff like this happens. It's not about slapping people's beliefs - it should be about teaching ideas and critical thinking.

I have never said that ID should not be taught - but rather it should be in religion class unless some empirical evidence can be found to support it's claims. No matter what your belief is, there is no empirical evidence supporting their claims yet. There is a lot of empirical evidence supporting gradual evolution however. It's science - ID is faith. By all means, teach ID. However, make sure that you teach it as it really is - not a scientific theory.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[You can certainly teach about creationism, intelligent design or just about anything in a Religion class to a very limited extent.  For the most part, the relevent details are already covered in Philosophy courses.

You cannot teach the debate between Evolution and ID in such a class however.  As I have mentioned before, to understand the debate and explore it requires a deep knowledge of Evolution.  That has to be taught in Science.

You have to know what Evolution says, what we can quite confidently say we KNOW about evolution, and what we do not know and how ID attempts to answer what we don't know.  I would find such a course fascinating, especially if taught be someone who consciously tried to present the best case for each side.  I doubt it would convince me that ID had taken place, but I would love to see it.

Teaching ID in a religious course seems to me to be a waste of everyone's time.  All you will do is avoid the debate, not embrace it.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I want to add that I am totally for exposing kids to new ideas - just in the proper settings. Any metaphysical theories should be presented in a religion, metaphysics or philosophy class. Scientific theories should be presented in a science class.

I guess that's where we differ. You feel that ID is science, while I do not see that.

I would be all for ID being taught as a scientific theory &lt;em&gt;if there were any evidence for it&lt;/em&gt;. However there is not. The ID'ers have not been their burden of proof.

Special and General Relativity was not so much a break from the established scientific though as ID is. It was also built on mathematical evidence. In the 50's it was tested, and found to be  an accurate model. It is science. ID simply points to holes in our understanding and says 'Someone must have done that!'. That's not science - that's guesswork.  Major difference.]]></wp:comment_content>

I have not seen this evidence. I have only seen the 'ID in the gaps' arguement, which fails every test.

&lt;blockquote&gt;If a college setting isn't an appropriate one in which to study or investigate something that isn't considered to be proven yet, where is the proper venue?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

College is the proper venue. High school probally is not.

I do not think that laws should be make to not teach or to teach anything. If a group of people wants their kids to be taught that the FSM will touch them with his mightly noodly appendage, more power to them!

However, I will try to sway opinion towards what I feel is correct. That's the political process. The Blogosphere has replaced the water cooler and before that the Salon in greece. It is the place to hash out ideas - to think, be thunk at and develop opinions.

And I really enjoy it as well :)]]></wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ok, so the whole weekly thing is on hold for the holidays. Discipline is not one of my strong suites. :) Expect a missive on the importance of discipline in the next few weeks.</p>


	<p>Anyways...</p>


<blockquote>Those old religious manuals were written for a time before stock markets and viral epidemics and robotics and biomedicine and capitalism and the internet, and even if they'd known about these things, their underlying message would have still been the same.. chill, love each other, do your work... They are preparation, no more.

	<p>The good ones don't tempt humans to contemplate God, but to perfect themselves on Earth. Being "at one with God" or "a part of the creator" is your birthright, sure, but you were born on planet Earth.</blockquote></p>


	<p>-<a href="http://corz.org/blog/index.php#%0A%09%09one%20word%2C%20maybe%20two..%0A">Corzblog</a></p>


	<p>I like the article - read it all.</p>


	<p>One of the things that I like about Buddhism, is it's realistic approach to life. It does not expect blind faith. It expects us to try, learn, and come to our own conclusions. I have talked at length about this before, but I saw a sign that really drove the point home for me.</p>


<blockquote>Feeding your faith,
starves your doubt
</blockquote>

	<p>I would posit that a liberal dose of doubt is healthy. When the church leader asks me to drink the KoolAid, I should be able to think on my own and and say 'No'. Reliance on faith leads to weak minds. Doubting, discussing, and dissension leads to strong minds.</p>


	<p>I once called faith a crutch. I do believe that it can be. It is very unhealthy when used to the extreme. Just because some one wrote it in a book does not make it true! You need to examine those words and beliefs, process them, and make sure that they have constancy and truth.</p>


	<p>Blind faith leads us to the Jonestowns and Wacos.</p>


	<p>We need to teach critical though, self examination and healthy doubt. We will not survive with out it.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Was &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Pope-poland.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; blind faith as well?

I don't think so.  Many people confuse strong faith with blind faith.  In my observation, the reverse is far more often true.  Most people of faith that I know came to their faith after deep sole searching and questioning.  Most still have questions, even doubts but they have faith as well, and humility to trust what they cannot be sure of one their own.

I have never been able to manage that last bit.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The link is of people cheering the pope. No faith involved there - we know the pope exists - after all he has a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/search?q=pope+hat&amp;amp;sourceid=mozilla-search&amp;amp;start=0&amp;amp;start=0&amp;amp;ie=utf-8&amp;amp;oe=utf-8&amp;amp;client=firefox&amp;amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:unofficial&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;pope-hat &lt;/a&gt; right? :)

If the Pope was not there, and had never been there, and had never been seen before, and people still cheered him, that would be faith.

Faith is a belief in something that cannot be proven. People have faith in God. I know that my car will work, because it works on defined natural concepts.

Buddhism is based on natural concepts as well. We know that if you have a positive outlook on life, you will tend to be happier. So in cultivating a postive outlook we can say that we will have a more happy life then someone with a more negitave outlook.

For me, that is the major diffrence between most world religons and Buddhism. Buddhism tells us to think for ourselves - others tell us to 'feed our faith'.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Let us not forget the pope-mobile!

The scary thing about basing your entire life on a particular faith, is that you never truly know what strings that faith is pulling behind the scenes.

Despite the good intention and belief of many religions, historically religion has always been about power, not love as their front-end claims.

People often place their faith in the wrong things, history is full of examples of this.  This, my friends, is what blind faith can do for you.

This does not mean that all religions have misguided intentions, nor that all religious figures are selfish and evil, but it should give you a reason to never blindly follow anyone or any religion.

One of my major reasons for not turning over my life to any particular following.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I don't think the people in that photo were expressing faith in the pope.  They were there because of what the pope represented, and were expressing their faith in their Church and their God.

Certainly no one doubts that 'faith' can be misplaced and misused.  People that put their trust in their own intellect, their faith in themselves and their ability to reason and to 'know' the correct answer make huge mistakes too though.

The 20th century taught us that quite well I should think.]]></wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of my problems with ID and it's attendant philosophies is that it assumes that we are special somehow. What folks fail to realize is that there are billions of earth like planets out there - and possibly billions of universes. We think that the universe was specially created for us because the cosmological constants are pretty much tailored for us. However, that's simply not the case.</p>


	<p>The constants are 'tailored' for us simply because we evolved under their rules. So we are in fact tailored to the environment that we evolved in, not the other way around.</p>


	<p>I think that some folks are bent on Humanity being 'special' somehow. Here is a news flash: We are not special. We are not the center of the universe. The universe was not designed for us, rather we were designed by the universe. If some of the constants had been different, we would have evolved differently - or not at all. To claim humanities specialness because the universe is so suited for us is to have it backwards. We are suited for the universe.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I hold the origins of the universe to be outside the scope of ID.  I understand that some have tried to include this, but I don't think it very useful.  Origins of the universe are pretty much outside of all science, and at this time the best we can do is philosophy on that.  ID and evolutionary science are both pretty weak on the origins of life as well.

I don't necessarily agree with you that ID implies or requires human exceptionalism.  Indeed the reverse seems to me to be true.  If something is causing the development of life and intelligence, I would expect life and intelligence to be much more common than if it is simply caused by random chance.  Even if one assumes ID to equal creationism, I don't know anything in creationist belief that demands Earth and Humanity be God's sole creation.

However, you are mistating or misunderstanding the concept of a tailored universe.  It is not that there we happen to fit the universe so much as we have a universe that things like this can happen.  From what I understand, as far as quantum physics can tell, things like gravity and the nuclear forces and eclectromagnatism are arbitrary.  If any were even slightly different starts, planets, galaxies and chemical compounds could not form.  It is hard to imagine anything 'evolving' to take advantage of such an environment, so the 'miracle' for lack of a better term that our universe works as it does is amazing.

Perhaps there are infinte universes and some that would work as ours does is therefore a certainty.  It still seems to me to be properly a source of wonder and awe.

One thing that is interesting to contemplate, is that IF we ever are able to understand the processes that created our universe, we may very well be able to create a universe ourselves.  Assuming we control it to have similar constants, Intelligence might very well occur and the process could repeat, presumably infinately.  Turtles all the way up if you will.  Given that quantum physics can't tell a difference between direction of time (from the math that we have, the present is just as likely to be caused by the future as the past) it seems that the 'turtles all the way down' might be possible as well.

Interesting stuff to think about.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;However, you are mistating or misunderstanding the concept of a tailored universe.

It is hard to imagine anything 'evolving' to take advantage of such an environment, so the 'miracle' for lack of a better term that our universe works as it does is amazing.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

That's what I said - if any of the physical constants were different, we would not have formed. We cannot have a conception of what would have formed, just &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWAG&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;WAG&lt;/a&gt;'s.

The reason that we are here to ask these questions is because the universe has these constants. If we think that the universe created it's self or was created just for us cannot be proven, nor disproven. We are what we are, and we are where we are.

I think what folks in the Religious communities are so up in arms about is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iheu.org/node/695&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Humanism&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The frontiers of astronomy are extending our knowledge in a dramatic way. Our planet and solar system are part of a vast expanding universe of billions and billions of galaxies. The human species exists within the biosphere and is continuous with nature. It has not been created by divine fiat, but is a result of a long process of evolution, in which adaptation, survival of the finest, chance genetic mutations, differential reproduction, and other factors play a role. The Darwinian revolution has thus dethroned man from the centre of an anthropomorphic universe. Contrary to religious doctrine, there is no dualism between mind and body, and no evidence for a separable immortal soul.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At first they recoiled in a purely religious manner - the Scopes trial was the end of that phase. Now, they are trying a more subtle approach - ID.

I do not think that there is some conspiracy out there; rather I feel that it's just people's way of coping. Many people need to belive in something larger then themselves. They need to feel that there is a reason, or reward at the end of the race.

The problem occurs when their deeply held beliefs come up against facts, and loose the battle. There is no concrete evidence for God, however you have statements like this from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608b.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;church&lt;/a&gt;:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Catholic position is once more reaffirmed and theological Agnosticism condemned. In its bearing on our subject, this act of Church authority is merely a restatement of the teaching of St. Paul and of the Vatican Council, and a reassertion of the principle which has been always maintained, &lt;b&gt;that God must be naturally knowable if faith in Him and His revelation is to be reasonable&lt;/b&gt;; and if a concrete example be needed to show how, of logical necessity, the substance of Christianity vanishes into thin air once the agnostic principle is adopted, one has only to point the finger at Modernism. Rational theism is a necessary logical basis for revealed religion; and that the natural knowledge of God and natural religion, which Catholic teaching holds to be possible, are not necessarily the result of grace, i.e. of a supernatural aid given directly by God Himself&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Emphasis mine.

I ask - if it was so evident that there was a 'first mover' why does religion have to codify that we can prove it? Why not just prove it?

To try and bring this back around - people have always had a need to feel special. Our conscious it's self is keyed in on the fact that we are self aware, but not aware of others except via external stimuli. For each of us, the universe rotates around us and our perceptions of the outside world. We are, in fact, alone in our own universe.

What we perceive is not fact. It is old data and processes through a huge computer bank. It takes time for the light or sound to reach us, and then more time for the receptors to fire, and more for the brain to receive and process the information into a usable state.

With that aloneness - which we understand at a unconscious level - we need to feel some connection. We invent higher purposes, and reasons for existing that would be laughable in any other conversation.

We feel alone, so we must be special. We can sense these other beings around us - but we are do not share &lt;em&gt;awareness&lt;/em&gt; with them. From that font comes the &quot;humanity is the center of the universe&quot;, and &quot;the universe was created for us&quot; thoughts.

Are we in a self-creating loop like universe? That is outside of our comprehension. That is like asking an ant what the moon is. It's fun to play what if's but when the rubber hits the road what is really important is trying to get it right here and now.]]></wp:comment_content>

I don't think so.  I can know that a rainbow is beautiful, but I am probably not able to prove it.

Does that mean rainbows must be ugly?

While is it a logical falacy to argue from consequentialism, I think it can be useful in a few limited cases where the subject is truely unknowable.  For example, I choose to believe in free will because it is better to believe in free will and be wrong than it is to believe we have no free will and be wrong.  (of course if we don't have free will, I don't have a choice about believing in it anyway.)

Along those lines, I choose to believe that their is a qualitative difference between man and other animals.  That morality and goodness means something for us, while it means nothing for them.

Logic and science and materialism are wonderful things, and very useful tools.  They do not represent the sum of all wisdom thoug.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;Does 'knowable' = provable'? &lt;/blockquote&gt;

I would hope so!

If you know something that cannot be proven, then it can probally be disproven, which makes it false in a universal sense.

In your rainbow thought - You might belive that a rainbow is beautful - but that is your subjective truth. Each person, from their own point of view, will hold their own opinion about it.

Things's subjective value does not exist.

In other words - you do not know that a rainbow is ugly nor beautful - you belive it to be one or the other.

Knowing something is knowing it to be true. Belief is subjective, knowledge is objective.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>Can you prove you love your wife?
<br />
</blockquote>

	<p>I tend to break the universe down into three parts:</p>


	<p><strong>The Subjective Universe</strong></p>


	<p>This is the realm of our feelings and beliefs. Love and Faith and Hate and God live here. It's all internal to our minds and psyche. There is no truth or proof here - only opinion and faith.</p>


	<p><strong>The Objective Universe</strong></p>


	<p>This is what we perceive. It's still not fact - but it's as close as we can get to truth by ourselves. Our perceptions are all edited for content by our subconscious as they are traveling the neural pathways into our minds. We basically have a few passive sensor systems - our eyes, ears, touch and smell (taste is part of smell). We have parts of our brains that are dedicated signal processors. They take as input the raw data from these sensory systems and output processed data that we can understand.</p>


	<p>There is a time lag between the perceptions and the post-processing data. So, the external world is not really perceived as it happens. The processing takes place in the subjective universe. Everything is spun according to the whims of your subconscious. This leads to...</p>


	<p><strong>The Real Universe</strong></p>


	<p>This is what is really real. We cannot directly perceive this. It's like the story of the four blind men and the elephant. We each base what we believe reality to be on our perceptions. It's only when we actually sit down and discuss what each of us perceive that we can come close to approximating what reality really is.</p>


<hr />

	<p>I see the universe as a matrix made up first of the bubbles of each persons subjective universe which are contained in overlapping fields of people's objective universes all contained in the greater real universe.</p>


	<p>So - to answer the question: No. I cannot prove it except through my actions. Love, Hate, Good, Evil - these are all parts of each of our subjective universes.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[How do you determine which universe is 'real'?

Descarte of course started with the first, as the only one that he could be sure was 'real' and was never able to convincingly get beyond it.

And if we are to trust quantum science, the 'real' universe that you describe may be as ephermal as anything in the subjective universe as you call it.

Love and Faith and Hope and all of that are as real to me, more real perhaps and more important than anything generated by a consensus of the blind.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[If you allow your feelings, hope and faith to rule you, then they are infact more real then the rest of the Universe. I would suggest that a Sucide Bomber is in this boat. He &lt;b&gt;feels&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;belives&lt;/b&gt; that what he is doing is justified. Same with folks who follow the means are justifed by the ends argument. (not that I am implying that you are either, Justus)

The danger lies in beliving that the subjective and objective universes are more real then the real universe. That is what allows fanatism to grow in a mind. If only your inner universes are real, then the other beings that inhabit the outer universe, the Real universe, must not be the same as you, if they really even exist.

I would propose that a health being would have a balanced view of the reality of the three realms. They would understand the interaction between the three. They would realize that what they percive as the universe is an illusion, transient and ethereal.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[He lives in all three of them - just like you and me.

I do not believe that people 'only live in one'. That would be impossible. Everyone has an internal monologue,  Everyone has some way of sensing the outside world (even if it's only through touch) and everyone exists in the real world. I think that some people give to much power or weight to their subjective universe, not seeing the larger picture.

I would say that a acceptable moral code would be totally based on a subjective view. Acceptable is a subjective term after all. What would be an acceptable to you would not be acceptable to a conservative Muslim. Your subjective paradigms are very different.

As our subjective universes determine our objective universes, the thing to realize is that when you see a 'thing', be it an action or physical thing, that thing could be very different in another persons objective reality.

If you think about it, subjective reality is created by our parents, our culture and our experiences. Buddhism is in part about learning how to see the real world for what it is. Basically seeing through your own objective reality. Seeing things for what they really are.

&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satori&quot;&gt;Satori&lt;/a&gt;, or enlightenment, is the point where we actually get a glimpse of the real world for what it is. Did you ever take those tests where they give you a bunch of dots or something and ask you what is there? That is designed to key off of the subjective minds interpretation of the form, which misleads you to show what it is not. Enlightenment is seeing all possibilities at once.

The first step towards &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kensho&quot;&gt;Kensho&lt;/a&gt; is realising that what you see is in fact not real. :)]]></wp:comment_content>

Mind is the psychic content, the stat of consciousness, the bundle of perceptions which are called impressions fi the are more lively sensations, and feelings or ideas (thoughts) if they are faint images of impressions.  Hume held that it is not substances or qualities that man percieves but his own subjective states, i.e. the impressions which enter by the senses.  Mind is constituted by the successive perceptions, and hen the substantiality of the ego is delusion.]]></wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote> A successful businessman went to a Zen master and announced he had come to learn all about Zen.  The master invited the man to sit down and have tea.  As the master poured the tea, it overflowed.  The businessman shouted, "It's spilling, it's spilling!"  To which the master replied, "Precisely-you came with a full cup.  Your cup is already spilling over, so how can I give you anything?  Unless you come with emptiness, I can give you nothing."

    Your journey . . . begines when you empty your mind of all the overused and undernourishing ideas you have inherited . . . Using your Beginner's Mind, you will see things in a refreshing, exhilirating way . . . Open yourself up to your unlimited potential . . . This is your initiation into the eloquence of the thinking body and the grace of the dancing mind.

    <em>Huang, Chungliang and Jerry Lynch.  Thinking Body, Dancing Mind:  TaoSports for extraordinary performance in athletics, business, and life.  Bantam, 1992, p. 29</em>.  </blockquote>

	<p>-<a href="http://www.beginners-mind.net/what_is.htm">What is the beginner's mind?</a></p>


	<p>I have made a career out of learning. No, not a career, a life. One of the things that I have found most important in this life of learning is to throw away preconceived notions. Approaching problems with an open mind is crucial. If you have some idea in your head about what is causing an issue, you can poison your mind to other options. Only with an open mind can you really see.</p>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[A good example of this is the technician that was working on our phone system yesterday.  He was attempting to troubleshoot why he could not get one of the phone jacks to work.  The method he was using was merely testing if another jack was working in a variety of different ways.  In his mind he was switching between the two jacks, but he was merely switching the same jack between to plugs in the phone switch.

The way I am explaining this might be losing something in the translation, but eventually another technician came along and had to explain to the first that he was not looking at the logic in his troubleshooting right.  The first technician could not clear his mind enough to understand that he wasn't testing the correct jack.

When we get something set in our minds one way, it is very difficult at times to step back and rethink the situation.  Religious discussions are notorious for this type of thought process.  People of varying religious beliefs are so ingrained in their life-long belief systems that they find it next to impossible to accept any other line of reasoning.

Some folks swear by Fords, and some by Chevy's, still others are die hard Honda followers, and then there is the type that have Diesel's on the brain.  Of course the Dodge fanatics are way out there.  ;)

This mental problem is why those people who can think 'outside the boxâ€ are a valuable asset to a company.  A business does not need folks who are mired in their own idioms, but people who can make the mental leaps necessary to cover a larger encompassing scope.

I pride myself on having an open mind and make a real effort to listen to all points of a discussion.  Like most people, I too occasionally fall victim to my own thoughts and seemingly have my own cup 'spilling overâ€.  Some people who know me ask where I find the time to read all the things that I read, or listen to talk radio, or watch the Science and Discovery channels.  The fact is, this is what I enjoy, and so in my spare time it is what I do.

In the car I listen to talk radio so I can stay current on events of the world, and more importantly so I can listen to several sides of a variety of discussions.  When at home, and the family has gone to bed, I work on my websites or read about whatever happens to be of interest to me at that moment.  If I am in a television mood, I may do the brain-dead thing and watch a sitcom, or spend a Sunday watching things like the Science or Discovery channels.

Since I tend to stay informed on many topics, I am also very aware that many people don't read or write much these days.  The older they get, many adults tend to lose their ability to read well, write well or even engage in meaningful conversations.  For some reason I can't function that way.  This is perhaps one reason I am working as a network administrator/engineer.  In my career the industry is always changing.  We literally learn new ways to do our jobs daily and have to adapt our thought processes accordingly.

Take a class on something that interests you.  Read a book, any book fiction or non, but exercise your mind and work on your reading skills.  When watching television, seek out the more informative channels, watch the news, or even something like an interior decorating or cooking show.  The key is to watch something informative, not mentally draining.  Write poetry, short stories, emails to your friends.  Nobody to write to?  Participate in forums on whatever website you find interesting.  At the very least take up a hobby.

In addition to everything else I have mentioned, I also enjoy the LGB train that goes around our Christmas tree every year and I read magazines about Garden Railways even though I currently do not have the time or money to create one of my own.  I am a scuba diver for the local water rescue team.  Currently I am maintaining about 8 websites (I lose count) and helping others create web pages and sites of their own.  My fish tank is something else that I enjoy, and the current crop of fish can't wait until I stop by every day to toss them their munchies.  This past year has brought two dogs into our home, and I love to feed the Quail, finches and hummingbirds in the backyard.

Can I continue with my interests and what I do in my life?  You bet.  Sometimes it's exhausting just listing my activities, and that's not even going into what needs to be done for my three daughters with school, Girl Scouts, Volleyball, Basketball, Flute and violin lessons, etc...

It's no wonder I am getting more gray by the day.

So keep your cup at least empty enough to allow new things to pour in.  Embrace life and live it by always searching for new experiences.  This is why I love my 'Life In A Handbasket Websiteâ€, because I get to write about a great many things and invite the world in for discussions.  Unfortunately the world does not know the site exists, but that has not stopped me from writing my articles for the past several years.

The final thing is not only must you maintain enough room in your personal cup to learn new things, but you must also pursue your interests even if the odds are against you.  Not many people read my articles, but I don't care.  They are written as a way for me to express myself and get out in words all of the strange and random thoughts I am mulling over as I live my life.

It was Albert Einstein that said, 'Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.â€  Do something different, right now, today!]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[There is no doubt that thinking we know something can be a barrier to learning.  Equally true is that some things, religion being an oft cited one, require us to abandon a lot of what we 'know' in order to comprehend it.

Taking from that the principle that it is better to know nothing than to know things is taking the principle way too far.  Equally, thinking outside the box is often overrated.  Sometimes it is needed, but most often the box is there for a reason and what works is, in fact, what works.

I would rather have a company that was 100% 'in the box' than have a company that was contantly trying to think outside of it.  A little creativity is good, refusing to use the tried and true because it isn't 'creative' enough isn't.]]></wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Justus posed an interesting question in a comment. I really felt that it needed more then just a comment in reply, as sometimes the paradox itself is central to the lesson
<blockquote>But shouldn't we become childlike instead of knowing things like that we are insignifigant?</blockquote>
Yes.

	<p>Also:</p>


	<p>No.</p>


	<p>It's deep man, but you have to balance your emptiness with fullness. It's like this:</p>


	<p>My mind is like a cup. If it holds (heh) one cup, and I put a cup of Schnapps in it, it is full, correct?</p>


	<p>What if I could make the cup larger? Make the cup hold 10 cups? Is it full now? Is is empty? Closer to which one? What if I made it able to hold 1000 cups of liquid?</p>


	<p>Our minds are like that. They are elastic, can stretch and bend and wiggle. If you work yours out, then you can stretch it to accept new ideas. If you are locked into one mode of thought, then your mind will become like a steel trap - rusted shut.</p>


	<p>The emptiness/fullness is just an analogy to reality - and a simple one at that. But it is very useful in teaching. We would never expect some one to unlearn everything that they ever knew to become truly empty. Rather, it's a way of looking at the world as created new each second. Not letting past experiences limit your outlook now.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><center>I see the magic in a leaf,
I see the wonder in a drop of rain.
I am enthralled with this world,
and all of the wonder that is has.</center></blockquote>

I have a very strongly held belief structure. It can be summed up in two statements:
<ul>
    <li>I believe that people should treat one and another with real compassion and as much understanding as they can muster.</li>
    <li>I belive that people should allow each other the space to make their own choices</li>
</ul>
These might seem contradictory in places, however they really flow into each other. By treating others with compassion, we should allow them to think for themselves. This allows them to grow stronger. Sheltering them only weakens them, and in the long run damages them. By allowing free choice, we give others the ability to grow stronger by making mistakes and learning from them.

	<p>However, this in no way means that we are to allow people to come to harm through our inaction. Rather it means we should allow them to make their own choices, think for themselves, and help when we can. Suffering and impermanence are parts of life - woven into the very essence of this universe. However, we must do what we can to help ourselves and others be as happy as we can.</p>


	<p>Before we can help others, we need to help ourselves. Have you ever flown? You know how they tell you to put your 0<sub>2</sub> mask on before you help others? Life is the same way. How can you help some one else, if you are broken, or breaking?</p>


<blockquote><center>I wander the fields
that Thoreau loved,
I taste the apples
in the buds of the blossoms
in the trees
where I grew up</center></blockquote>

	<p>I love to be out of doors, and I enjoy this fine area that we are blessed to live in. Everything that I experience right now is processed through my past experiences, making a tapestry interwoven with memories, sights and sounds. I understand what I can touch, see and smell. I try and use what logical ability that I have to understand what is beyond my senses, as there is a world beyond our weak perceptions. If it's the universe of the super small strings that might make up the atoms that make up the molecules that make us up, or the world of the large - stellar bodies spinning at break neck speeds through the empty universe, and yet clustered into great spinning masses, This universe is indeed wonderful!Events, however, show us that we are a small part of this universe. We are not the center of the universe, and we need to get used to that fact. When we realize our place in the grand scheme of things we will be one step closer to happyness.</p>


<blockquote><center>I try and dance
on the head of a pin
at least twice a week!
I call to angels,
I see the beauty
in a rusty old car</center></blockquote>

	<p>I treat others with as much compassion and love that I can muster. I bring humor to most situations. I am nothing if not imperfect - I get angry in traffic with the best of them. However I do try and reflect on this, and grow from the experience. I try to give people the same breaks that I my self look for. I have found that driving a large truck has increased my patience. When I drive a small car, I zoom about. When I drive a 7000 pound hunk of steel, there is no zooming. There is just measured progress.Life is like that. I watch the people who 'zoom' through life at breakneck speeds and never get anything done. I try to observe, and plan my actions to achevie the greatest effect. Some times, the slow car wins the race!</p>


<blockquote><center>Laughing, I leap
off cliffs to the water
below
Splashing down
Drinking life up</center></blockquote>

	<p>I often try and take 'the road less traveled'. God put a head on my shoulders, and I try to make the most of using it. I have studied many philosophies, and cull the wheat from each to form my own opinion. Everything has worth, when seen through the right eyes.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[&quot;Everything has worth, when seen through the right eyes.&quot;

What of poverty?  What of hunger?
I agree with most of your statements, although I giggled a bit with your truck analogy.  From the standpoint of a girl with a motorcycle (zooming about), sometimes bigger is not always better...sometimes slow is just that - slow. ;)

I am part of a team researching PTSD right now, in adolescents of trauma centers (UWMC).  Sadly, I see the lowest-of-lows in certain situations.  I see teenagers influenced by their parents' inadequacies and a few desperate cases of MBP.  In such a world, when you are constantly seeing the bad part of life and are in constant contact with such lows, it is hard to &quot;allow each other the space to make their own choices.&quot;]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Poverty and Hunger can be powerful motivators to the afflicted to bootstrap themselves up, and to others to lend a hand.

I agree - it is hard to allow others to make their own choices - but I did add &quot;&lt;em&gt;and help when we can. Suffering and impermanence are parts of life - woven into the very essence of this universe. However, we must do what we can to help ourselves and others be as happy as we can.&lt;/em&gt;&quot;

Sounds like you are well into the helping others :)]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I guess I am looking at the &quot;worth&quot; of poverty and hunger from the standpoint of the afflicted person.  I sadly see the 'povertization' of women often, in circumstances where, when a child is hungry and the missions are full, the hospital is the last place to go.  By law, they get free food and 6 hours of shelter (whether they can pay or not).  I see no worth in their suffering, from their side.  There may be worth in my young, compassionate (and sometimes naive) heart - but that seems paltry in comparison to the desperation of a previously abused mother who is trying to support her kids working minimum wage.
Is there truly a &quot;worth&quot; in this circumstance?  Even if it is so small as to be overpowered by the worthlessness of it?]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;a Buddhist tries to look upon suffering not as something necessarily &quot;bad,&quot; but as an opportunity to learn and grow. In that sense, it might be said that Buddhists try to look upon suffering and difficulties as something potentially positive, as a kind of &quot;teacher.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It sucks, and I never wish suffering on anyone - and when they are suffering, I try and help.

However, as I said, we need to try and show compassion by helping those that are suffering. :)]]></wp:comment_content>

<title>Instead of ID, IC?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>ID vs. IC: what is the distinction? Simply put, Intelligent Design posits that the universe needs a cause, but that the cause is a creature who designs and plans like a limited human being (but with supernatural powers), and this creature appeared from nowhere (by accident?) and needs no cause or creator of its own (the 'first causeâ€ idea). Infinite Causes, on the other hand, is so named because of the belief that there are an infinite number of causes and conditions that made the world the way it is. There is no 'first cause' or 'one cause' because all things are intertwined in an endless web of causality with no beginning and no end. Both natural and supernatural forces may be involved.</blockquote>
-<a href="http://www.geocities.com/Xenodharma/IDIC.html">Teaching alternatives to evolution: How to distinguish the Buddhist "Infinite Causes" and Christian "Intelligent Design" theories</a>

	<p>If the ID proponents want ID taught in school - then we certainly should include alternate theories of the creation of the universe. This is one of them.</p>


A lot of the argument for ID seems to hinge on two points:
<ol>
    <li>Life is too complex to have emerged on it's own</li>
    <li>The universe is too finely tuned to our needs to have happened by random chance</li>
</ol>
As far as point 2 goes - IC states:
<blockquote>According to some cosmologists, the universe began as a quantum fluctuation in the limitless Void (Hartle Hawking cosmology). In the absence of an observer, the evolving universe remained as a 'multiverse' - a coherant quantum superposition of all logically possible states...

	<p>...<a href="http://home.btclick.com/scimah/Quantumphenomena.htm">Quantum theory</a> states that any physical system remains in a superposed state of all possibilities until it interacts with the mind of an observer. Both quantum theory and Buddhist teachings on <a href="http://home.btclick.com/scimah/sunyata.htm">sunyata</a> suggest that as soon as an observer's mind makes contact with a superposed system, all the numerous possibilities collapse into one actuality. At some instant one of these possible alternative universes produced an observing lifeform - an animal with a nervous system which was sufficiently evolved to form <a href="http://home.btclick.com/scimah/Symbioticmind.htm">a symbiotic association   with a primordial mind.</a> The first act of observation by this mind caused the entire superposed multiverse to collapse immediately into one of its numerous alternatives.</p>


	<p>That one alternative version of the multiverse was not just the first configuration to be inhabitable by mind. The fact that it was the <strong>first</strong> configuration also   guaranteed that it was the<strong> only</strong> configuration. All uninhabited alternative universes, ranging from the nearly-but-not-quite habitable few, to the anarchic and unstructured vast majority, were instantly excluded from potential existence. According to the participatory anthopic principle the evolving multiverse was thus always destined to resolve itself into a sufficiently ordered state to allow itself to be observed.</blockquote>
So, according to this theory, the universe is the way it is because it was observed to be the way it is. Thus, the universe is completely suited to life's existence - down to <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/planck-s-constant?method=8">Planck's constant</a>. Which, if it was off by more then a few hundredths of a percent would not have allowed matter to form.</p>


	<p>It's an interesting thought!</p>]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I certainly agree that it is an interesting concept.  Basically, it is that the universe boot-strapped itself into existance. Interestingly enough, depending on the level of intelligence needed to be the quantum observer, it might indeed make us the center and, from a certain point of view, the creator of the universe.

Of course that theory sheds little light on mechanisms of evolution itself, being primarily confined to purely the origin of the universe.  I would have no problem with it being taught in such a forum.  The existence of the 'primordial minds' seem even more difficult to demonstrate than that of an unknown designer, but the basic concept of a quantum flux unverse coallescing a single probabily stream seems  fair enough.

I will also not that the first site you link to does not contrast IC with ID, rather it contrasts IC with Biblical Creationism.  As an example, ID explicity denies the 'young earth' of Biblical Creationists.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[ID does not contrast with Biblical Creationism, only with Literalist Biblical Creationism, a view held by a minority of Christians. For instance, the Catholic Church does not support Young Earth Creationism, and it represents the single largest concentration of Christians extant. Of course, the Catholic Church officially disavows the Intelligent Design currently en vogue in the US. ID is in fact an artifice of a group of Christian Creationists who view it as a 'toe in the door' to getting God back in the Classroom. The origins of the current &quot;Intelligent Design&quot; 'theory' is the Discovery Institute, a Christian Think tank. A little bit of quality time with Google will expose the ID movement as a Christian Creationist front to anyone who is not ideologically dedicated to Christianity in the first place.

From first blush, however, I would say that IC has almost exactly the same amount of scientific support as ID, but without the same ideological agenda (ie, it doesn't appear to offer any leverage for introducing Buddhism to the classroom categorically, whereas ID begs the question 'What Intelligence?' - and show me a single ID proponent that would not answer some indication of the Judeo-Christian mythos ), and so is likely to find more support among 'real' scientists of a more mystical bent.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Yeah - I wrote about that &lt;a href=&quot;http://geek.nokes.name/archives/189&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; a while back. It seems like a protection racket to me. I am so freaking fed up with Windows in general. It's not like it's even a good OS anymore.

I would like to see Dell buy RedHat or Novell and bust out their own linux based OS. Preload and pre-configure it on all of their machines to insure that it just works out of the box. Could you imagine Dell shipping $399 machines with a fully functional Linux distro on it?

DellOS.

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I found a great patch for all Windows vulnerabilities last year... &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;

:)

Being a *nix weenie by trade, I've not been much of a windows fan for years, and only used it because my work required applications that only run on Windows. The patch above solves that problem for me fairly nicely. Heh.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Heh. I did that awhile ago. But, before that, I jumped from Windows to Linux (about '01). I love Linux - I just got tired of the 'what digital camera can I buy? What mini-dv camcorder? What scanner works?' questions.

At home, I run a Linux server and firewall, and Macs for the user interface.]]></wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>The Buddha said: "If outsiders speak against me, the Teaching, or the Order,  you should not be angry, for that would prevent your own self-conquest. Similarly, if they praise us. But you should find out what is false or true, and acknowledge  the fact. And even in praise it is only of trifling matters that an unconverted  man might speak of me."</blockquote>
I am really intolerant of intolerant people!

Thus goes the circle of hate and bigotry. I have read several comments to articles in the last weeks that have really hit this point home:
<blockquote>I'm all for humor and poking fun. However these folks find the show offensive. If it was Buddha or Mohamad showing up would it be any less offensive?</blockquote>

<blockquote>it is either the truth or a lie, but chritianity espouses no theories.why do you not rail against ra , vishnu or the odyssey? is it because your not afraid they might be true? (<a href="http://www.answers.com/sic&#38;r=67">sic</a>)</blockquote>

	<p>However, a rigid worldview based on the teachings of a book - any book - might not be the best way to approach things. We have an amazing intellect at our beck and call, and yet so many people shelve it to allow others to do their thinking for them. They let their governments choose what is good and bad for them, and they sit in churches letting a pastor, priest or imam tell them what to think about social and philosophical topics.</p>


	<p>It's this kind of reliance on others thinking for your basic belief structure that breeds <a href="http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=0006A854-E67F-13A1-A67F83414B7F0104">murdercide</a> and the <a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/abo_viol.htm">bombing of abortion clinics</a>. If you really have the truth, why do you need to kill people that disagree? It's only through your own disbelief that such acts are fostered. And that really troubles me. It's like the world needs a wake up call. 9/11 seems to not have been it. What's next?</p>


I will leave with some thoughts from the Dalai Lama:
<blockquote>Buddha always emphasized the rational pursuit of truth. "He instructed his disciples to critically judge his words before accepting them. He always advocated reason over blind faith."

	<p>"Buddha was speaking about reality," says the Dalai Lama. "Reality may be one, in its deepest essence, but Buddha also stated that all propositions about reality are only contingent. Reality is devoid of any  intrinsic identity that can be captured by any one single proposition ,  that is what Buddha meant by "voidness." Therefore, Buddhism strongly discourages blind faith and fanaticism."</p>


	<p>"Of course, there are different truths on different levels. Things are true relative to other things; "long" and "short" relate to each other, "high" and "low," and so on. But is there any absolute truth? Something self-sufficient, independently true in itself? I don't think so."</p>


	<p>"In Buddhism we have the concept of "interpretable truths," teachings that are reasonable and logical for certain people in certain situations. Buddha himself taught different teachings to different people under different circumstances. For some people, there are beliefs based on a Creator. For others, no Creator. The only "definitive truth" for Buddhism is the absolute negation of any one truth as the Definitive Truth."</blockquote>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Buddhism of course is not free from terrorists either.

One has to wonder if reliance on an authority figure for guidance about morality is inherently wrong, why you would quote the Dalia Lama.

I also question the concept that disliking the protrayal of ones religion in a public forum, and expressing that dislike is part and parcel with blowing other people up.  One can find criminals and murders who ostensibly believe any philosophy known to man.  Some of them use whatever religious or philosophical beliefs they hold as justification for their crimes.

Further, the notion that religion is the driving force behind any terrorism (rather than an excuse for it) doesn't seem to fit the facts that we have very well.  Terrorism seems to arise from political, rather than religious aims and terrorist themselves seem to be based upon an alienation and political impotence with relgion being a cover for those feelings.  If religion didn't exist another means of group identification would take its place.  Human's being a gregarious species, group identification will always exist.

I expect that you would deny, and be mildly offended by someone who claimed that you were merely parroting the teachings of Buddhism and didn't apply any critical thinking of your own in analyzing those teachings.  I don't see therefore why you would assume that those of a different faith don't approach things in the same way.  Perhaps it is that you are sure that anyone who 'thought' about things would of necessity agree with you, if so that is an amazing degree of arrogance.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[There is not a international network of Buddhist terrorists that I am aware of - but that does not mean that Buddhists cannot be violent. I would question a violent Buddhist and their motives as much as I question a violent Christian or Muslim.

Here is the rub however - All of the Middle Eastern religions seem bent on destroying anyone who does not agree with them. Look to the Crusades and the current spat of terror. I agree that there are other circumstances that contribute to these acts of horror, however the common thread is following a religion based on the holding of absolute truth. I believe that absolute truth (and the possession of it) breeds intolerance, and intolerance breeds violence.

Look at the question of Homosexual marriage in the United States. Would it harm a Christian to allow some one to make that choice? In any manner? No. But some Christians make a Federal case out of the matter - not only forcing their morality onto others, but encoding into the legal system.

Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. I say that if the Christians were a minority in this country, they would be just as hurt and offended if another group conspired to take their rights to worship as they see fit away, or their right to marry and carry bibles or what ever. They have this great rule - their golden rule - and many of them simply do not follow it except to pay it lip service.

Perhaps it's just human nature to treat your fellow beings with disdain and disregard, however I for one think that the world would be a better place with a touch more compassion and tolerance. I have walked the path of the Christian, and the majority that I personally found were hollow people made out of plastic. The type that read the bible on Sunday with tears in their eyes, proclaiming the love for love it'self - and as they pull out of the Church's parking lot, and flip another driver off with hatred in their eyes.

A grand example - I was trying to merge into traffic a few years ago. A lady in a minivan, with her three kids and Jesus stickers plastered all over the back, screamed at me because she thought that I cut her off. She used some pretty foul language. Honestly, I do not think that I did cut her off, but I might have. So, I yelled back at her, &quot;Jesus loves you too!&quot; and she turned white.

I get really tired of hypocritical and intolerant people - be they Buddhists, Wiccans, Christians or Atheists. Honestly, I feel that intolerance is a sign of immaturity. I don't really know - but I do know that I was pretty intolerant when I was younger. I probably am still - but of different things now. I truly am intolerant of intolerance. :)]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Do &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=21862&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;these guys&lt;/a&gt; count?

Most people seem bent on destroying anyone who is not 'their kind.'  No region of the world has been free from war and violence for any signifigant period of time.  Religion is often used as a means to define the 'other' but people would tend to find some means regardless.

Do you think that most Buddhists have a deep understanding of their religion or are they just as plastic as the Christians?  Certainly there are plenty of hippocrits out there.  Few of us match up to our ethical beliefs regardless of what the source of those beliefs is.

Naturally in a majority Christian nation, the majority of the jerks one encounters will be Christian.  It would be nice if a religios belief, any religios belief (or even not having a religious belief at all) would make the believers into instant saints.  Doesn't work that way.

I don't know that this is the time or the place to get into the gay marriage debate, and I agree with you that it should be legal, but it is worth noting that your moral view that homosexual marriage should be tolerated and legally recognized is something that you want to be 'encoded into the legal system.']]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[As far as Aum Shin Rikyo goes - I would say, um, no.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The cult's tenets are based on ancient yoga and primitive Buddhism. They also worship the Hindu god Shiva, who holds the keys to both destruction and creation. Destruction and creation, in the cult's view, are one in the same.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

So, they take what they want from Buddhism, Hindusm, and who knows what else, and forge their own path.

&lt;blockquote&gt;In all of Buddhist history, there has never been a holy war. Surely Buddhist kings have waged war against one another, and they may even have claimed to be doing so for the benefit of humankind or the Buddhist religion, but they could not quote any saying of the Buddha to support them. The Buddha was quite clear in his renunciation of violence: &quot;Victory creates hatred. Defeat creates suffering. The wise ones desire neither victory nor defeat... Anger creates anger... He who kills will be killed. He who wins will be defeated... Revenge can only be overcome by abandoning revenge... The wise seek neither victory nor defeat.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

as opposed to the bible, which is rife with intolerance and God sponsored violence. There are plenty of gems in the rough as it were, however the way the bible is today is simply medival.

I never said nor belived that any religion will make any person into a saint. I belive that some religions are based on a faulty foundation, however. What scares me is not the foundations - it's that people are trained to simply accept the teachings with out thinking.

For me, Gay Marrage is not a moral issue. It's simply granting folks the rights to make their own moral choices. I might or might not agree with it - but it's not my place to tell some one that they cannot do something which does no harm to others.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Interesting discussion.  At times, Tsykoduk, it appears that you are attempting to make a case for moral relativism.  The dominant Western ethics is undeniably based on a Judaeo-Christian foundation, and I wonder what you think of the proposition that it may have evolved that way because it is a workable system to regulate the behavior of human beings living in large communities.

That proposition is quite different than stating that subscribers to a Judaeo-Christian based morality are mindless automatons following the directions of an outdated book authored by ignorant desert nomads in remote antiquity.  Please also note that approximately 50% of humanity has an IQ less than 100, and, in those people, it is quite useful to have them entrained to parroting a workable system of ethics.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I don't think that &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;of the followers of said Judaeo-Christian moral underpinnings are mindless. I think that there is a underlying current in the teachings to simply accept said teachings on Faith, rather then to make sure that they are constant and valid. And, while it might have been a good way to control the masses in the past, I think that we are at a point in our evolution as a society (we westerners) where the 'old ways' are not good enough anymore. We are facing one of the most radical changes to our way of life over the next 40 years that has ever happened. We need a new outlook.

On that topic - Judaism and Christianity have very little in common, other then coming out of the same portion of the world - but that's another topic :)

I think that many of the issues with &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Jones&quot;&gt;Kool Aid&lt;/a&gt; in the past might have been mitigated if we taught more moral, ethical and commonsensical self-reliance to our children.

As far as Moral Relativism - I would say that it is correct in many cases. However, there are some underlying morals that should cross sociopolitical boundaries - not harming others for example. Again, however &quot;&lt;em&gt;The on&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;ly 'definitive truthâ€...is the absolute negation of any one truth as the Definitive Truth.&lt;/em&gt;â€, what ever that means :)]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Since the Vatican has endorsed evolution is it no a religious theory and should it be banned from being taught in schools?

The idea that this will 'lay the issue to rest' is absurd.

To a large extent, those who espose young earth creationism also believe that the pope is evil and that the Roman Church is 'the whore of babylon.'  While I don't hold with either of those beliefs, it is pretty obvious that the Vatican coming out on one side of this debate won't end it.

I frankly question the propriety of the Vatican opining on a Scientific issue at all.  If the Vatican wanted to come out against ID on theological grounds I would certainly support them doing so.  You can make a very good case that ID is very bad Christian theology, and that is the Vatican's area of authority and expertise.  A Vatican statement on the merits of a scientific theory doesn't hold any weight at all for me.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The Vatican did not endorse evolution - they said &quot;&lt;em&gt;'intelligent designâ€ is not science and that teaching it alongside evolutionary theory in school classrooms only creates confusion.&lt;/em&gt;&quot;.

What I see here, is that they are helping to 'draw the line in the sand' between religion, faith, science and empericalism.

I agree that a lot of folks do not listen to the Pope. That's OK. You still have someone who is recognized as an authority by a large number of folks saying that ID &lt;&gt; Science. It will not lay it to rest, I am sure, but it's certainly a step in the right direction.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Why though would you welcome any religious authority ruling on what is or is not science?

The Popes view on this matter based upon his authority as a religious figure is no more dispostive than that of Jerry Falwell.

I wouldn't grant any credibility to Martha Steward ruling on what is or is not car racing, neither do I place any particular value on a religious leader saying what is and is not science.

Martha Stewart might be correct if she said go-cart racing isn't car racing, but that could only be based upon the merits of her argument, not on her authority as a recognized expert in vegatable centerpieces.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[He is not an authority on Science, but he is an authority on Religion. Esp, Christian religion, which is the religion espoused by the majority of IDers. So, now we have Authorities in Science saying that it's not science, and we have Religious Authorities saying that it's religion, not science.

Honestly, what more do you want?]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Facchini who actually wrote the specific article in question is of course a scientist, and I have no problem with what he said.

The Pope in fact has been slightly less clear on the issue.  Leaving that aside though, what I question is why you would welcome the basic idea that a religious figure should have any special authority in determining what is, or is not, science.

You seem to have a mentral construct that says if something is science it cannot be religious and vice versa.  I don't know if their is any basis for that belief.  While I accept that some things may be purely in the realm of one or the other, I don't know that that means all things must be in one realm or the other.

For example, both science and religion seem to agree that children are produced by copulation between a male and a female.  Does this mean that one of those two should be banned from discussions about such things?

The pope can probably opine on whether something is 'religious' or not.  Although his expertise might be too narrow even for that.  Claiming that a deduction of something being 'religious' means it cannot be science and therefore the Pope can rule if something is science seems a huge stretch to me.

I don't want Religious figures deciding what is or is not science whether I agree with them or not.  It isn't their role.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[A Scientist says that ID is not Science. The Vatican agrees with said Scientist, in fact endorsing his view by publishing it. Sounds pretty cut and dried to me.
&lt;blockquote&gt;reÂ·liÂ·gion (rÄ­-lÄ­j'É™n) pronunciation
n.

1.
1. Belief in and reverence for a supernatural power or powers regarded as creator and governor of the universe.
2. A personal or institutionalized system grounded in such belief and worship.
2. The life or condition of a person in a religious order.
3. A set of beliefs, values, and practices based on the teachings of a spiritual leader.
4. A cause, principle, or activity pursued with zeal or conscientious devotion.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
vs
&lt;blockquote&gt;sciÂ·ence (sÄ«'É™ns) pronunciation
n.

1.
1. The observation, identification, description, experimental investigation, and theoretical explanation of phenomena.
2. Such activities restricted to a class of natural phenomena.
3. Such activities applied to an object of inquiry or study.
2. Methodological activity, discipline, or study: I've got packing a suitcase down to a science.
3. An activity that appears to require study and method: the science of purchasing.
4. Knowledge, especially that gained through experience.
5. Science Christian Science.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
They seem pretty different to me - and rightly so. One is about explaining all that can be explained in a rational, empirical manner, and one is about musing about what cannot be explained.

I think that the concrete world's separation from the world of religion and spirituality is important.

The Pope can say what ever he wants. I think that he should be listened to in regards to Catholicism, and perhaps broad strokes of Christianity at large. But, like the Dali Lama is not the final word on Buddhism, The Pope is not the ruler of all things Christian. However, as his entire life he has studied these topics, perhaps Christians should listen to what he has to say, and reflect on it.

Even if he has a Pope Hat.]]></wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>The controversy regarding the Danish cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed completely misses the point. Of course, the cartoons are offensive to Muslims, but newspaper cartoons do not warrant the burning of buildings and the killing of innocent people. The cartoons did not cause the disease of hate that we are seeing in the Muslim world on our television screens at night - they are only a symptom of a far greater disease.</blockquote>
-<span class="storyhead">  <a href="http://www.portal.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2006/02/12/do1205.xml&#38;sSheet=/opinion/2006/02/12/ixop.html">We were brought up to hate - and we do</a>, by </span><a href="http://www.noniedarwish.com/pages/745434/"><span class="storyby">Nonie Darwish</span></a>

	<p>A good read.</p>


	<p>Only by spreading the meme of Love will we overcome this current disease of hatred. I know that sounds really hokey - but it's true. Killing them only makes their resolve stronger. Killing us only makes our resolve stronger. The weapons are not bullets and bombs but rather are hate filled minds. Only by defusing those weapons will we ever win this war.</p>


	<p>The West cannot do it. Only the Muslim world can do it. Let's hope that the moderates can prevail. I hate to think what will happen if they do not.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Obviously if I loved someone I would be less likely to kill them than if I hated them.  The problem is though, that hatred exists.

Spreading the meme of love implies, to me at least, some action that can be taken to change hatred into love.

I don't know what that is.  I don't know of any historical example of when that has happened.

Are you actually proposing some course of action to take or is this just a nice thought like 'war is bad'?]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Let's continue with my thought process.

If you loved everyone, would you be more or less likely to kill a random person?

Yes - hatred exists. However, we can overcome hatred with discourse, understanding and love. It's not a quick process. You cannot drop a Love Bomb and convert a populace.

However, look at the history of this conflict. It goes back to the Middle Ages, and before. You could even say that it started in Biblical times. That is when this hatred was born. I don't think that it can be solved in the next 10 years. It took 2,000 years for this thing to get where it is today, it's going to take a while to get it fixed.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I suppose that depends on how one chooses to define 'this conflict.'  From one perspective, hatred of 'the other' almost certainly predates homo sapiens.  At the other exteme, Muslim hatred of enlightenment philosophies certainly cannot predate the enlightenment itself.

It would also be simplistic to view this conflict as only a Muslim vs. Christian or a Muslim vs. the West prism.  Islam seems to be embroiled in conflict on all it's borders, whether with Christians, Secularists, Jews, Hindus or Buddhists.  Certainly we can't lay all of that on the story of Jacob and Esau.

However we wish to solve it, we may not have 2,000 years to do it in.  10 might be impossible, but 25 may well be as much as we can plan upon having.  Given the rising Muslim youth population and other demographic trends and accelleration of technology which will make individual capacity for destruction greater and greater this is something that we have a pretty short time frame to accomplish.  If a 'love' campaign predicates 2000 years of 'undoing hatred' then it seems to me to be totally impracticle.

On the other hand, given the statement of Ayatollah Sistani on the cartoon controversy, a militarized change the conditions in the Middle East strategy might be possible.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;a militarized change the conditions in the Middle East strategy might be possible.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Will a gun change someone's mind about something so fundamental as your inherent goodness?

If some one hates you, and you point a gun at you will he hate you less?

I guess that I feel that a military solution is not a solution. It might buy us some time, but it only treats the symptoms. It might allow a real solution to be brought into place, however, it is not the solution that any civilized person should be looking for.

So there is some one over there that says if we back him rather then the other guy, all will be good. That is what got us into the present situation. What's to prevent him from turning on us when we are no longer convenient? When we are no longer enemies with his enemies? When we win his war for him?]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I certainly agree that backing a thug because he is on our side is a short sighted strategy.  In some cases (Pakistan is a great example here) it may be necessary at certain points in time, but it can certainly be expected to cause some problems in the future.

However, backing someone who shares many of our basic principles is a different thing.

I don't believe that the conditions in many nations of the middle east are 'neutral.'  Those that currently are employing violence, both terror groups and autocratic governments are using that power to promote anti-western views and stifle the debate.  Guns cannot change hearts and minds, as you have pointed out, however they certainly can prevent people from changing hearts and minds.

We can, be removing those violent people, create a space where the debate can exist.  Afghanistan and Iraq are both better off, and more 'on our side' than they were before the military invasions of those countries.  Perhaps most importantly for a long term solution, they are now places where the meaning of Islam and it's relation to government and other peoples can, and is, being debated.  This would not have happened without military action.

Will all of these debates go exactly as we would wish?  Of course not.  But the existence of the debates are themselves and important step, and something to be valued.  Similar dynamics, although less positive for us in the short term at least, are taking place in Palestine.  I expect that that debate will also be very positive in the long term, as long as the ability to debate is maintained in that territory.]]></wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>Feb. 21, 2006 â€” A new study of the Arctic permafrost forecasts that global warming will thaw and shrink the total area of perennially frozen ground 60 to 90 percent by 2100.</blockquote>
-<a href="http://dsc.discovery.com/news/briefs/20060220/permafrost_pla.html?source=rss">Discovery Channel News</a>

Are we approaching the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tipping_point">tipping point</a>, or are we past it?
<blockquote>If true, it will...lead to the release by soils of vast doses of greenhouse gases, and upset ecosystems over wide areas</blockquote>
-<a href="http://dsc.discovery.com/news/briefs/20060220/permafrost_pla.html?source=rss">Discovery Channel News</a>

	<p>Where would these greenhouse gasses come from? How about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siberia#Geography_and_geology">Siberia</a>? A large portion of Siberia is made up of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histels"><strong>Histels</strong></a>, "<em>which are  organic soils that have permafrost within 2 meters below ground surface. They have 80 % or more organic materials from the soil surface to a depth of 50 cm or to a glacic layer or densic, lithic, or paralithic contact, whichever is shallowest.</em>"</p>


	<p>What does that mean? There is lots of frozen organic mush in the ground up there. If that were to thaw, we would see a methane plume hit the air which could cause more thawing, which would cause...</p>


	<p>You get the picture.</p>


	<p>Honestly, I do not know if <a href="http://foreven.com/libdat/libdat/h/Humaniti.htm">Humaniti</a> is to blame or not, or if we can even stop it. However, we need to be forearmed. Massive environmental change is not uncertain - it will happen, and is happening around us right now. Sort of like a massive impact scenario. It's gonna happen folks. The question is if we will be prepared.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>Buddhism is not a religion because 'belief' in the Buddha's teachings is not blind belief, blind faith, and far from superstition. Shakyamuni Buddha taught us not to blindly believe what he tells us, he wants us to try the teachings and prove them for ourselves. The Buddha wants us to know, not merely believe.</blockquote>
-<a href="http://www.brown.edu/students/Buddhism_Society/profiledir/chinkung.html">Chin Kung</a><a href="http://www.brown.edu/students/Buddhism_Society/profiledir/chinkung.html"> </a>

	<p>The difference between what Christianity teaches and what Buddhism teaches is vast - not only in theology, but also in philosophy. Christianity teaches us to have faith in it's teachings, and the book that they are based on. It's like Ice Cream manufactures telling us that Ice Cream is the best food ever, and all we should ever eat is Ice Cream.</p>


If you dare question, you are subject to many punishments. They range from burning at the stake in yesteryear to social and civic penalties today.
<blockquote>You shouldn't think something just because you believe it. You need reasons. That applies to religion. That applies to politics . . . just because your parents believe something isn't good enough.</blockquote>
-<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bart_Ehrman">Bart Ehrman</a>

As more and more people start to dig deeply into their Christian Faith, some are seeing that it is a house of cards. There is no historical evidence to support the Bible's claims. If people want to believe in Christianity, I have no problem with that - however I do have a problem when they tell me that the Bible is The Truth.
<blockquote>There are some 5,700 ancient Greek manuscripts that are the basis of the modern versions of the New Testament, and scholars have uncovered more than 200,000 differences in those texts.

	<p>"Put it this way: There are more variances among our manuscripts than there are <em>words</em> in the New Testament," Ehrman summarizes.</blockquote>
-<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/03/04/AR2006030401369.html?sub=AR">The Book of Bart, at the Washington Post</a></p>


	<p>Here's a wake up call - truth is subjective. It depends on the circumstances. There is no universal truth that we have ever found. Your way might be right for you, but that does not give you the mandate to force your way on others! It does not give you the right to kill, imprison, maim, or ostracize those that have a different truth.</p>


	<p>Words work - tell others why you believe this way, what evidence you have. Through discourse, ideas spread, and perhaps you will get more and more people to agree with you.</p>


	<p>This does not work if you have no reasons to believe what you believe. This tension between a person's heartfelt belief and their lack of reason for that belief is what fosters radicalism.</p>


	<p>"I cannot convince you that I am right because I have no evidence, so I am going to make it a law!" or kill, or whatever.</p>


	<p>Well, you know what? If ya'll don't get more tolerant, I am going to pass laws to force ya'll to become good little Buddhists.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[So, you believe that there is only one truth?

Also - Who's word am I taking?

Let's look at the evidence.

1) The gospel was written years after Jesus's life - not by the actual apostles.

2) There are not any historical references to Jesus, other then the bible

3) The gospel was translated many times, and re-scribed many times. We do not have originals.

4) There are lots of problems with translating from Greek (which the gospels were written in, not in Jesus's native tongue), and ambiguities exist.

Leaving out faith, with these facts, we can easily draw the conclusion that the bible might not in fact be 100% fact. If it's not 100% fact, then it's not the inspired word of God. If it's not the inspired word of God, then it's mythology.

I have no problems with people believing in mythology. However, their faith should be grounded in the realization that other faiths are just as valid.

Just because some one else says this, and I quote them I am taking their word for it? I have felt this way for many years.]]></wp:comment_content>

I base my view of Christianity off current events and my upbringing in a Lutherian and later a Southern Baptist Church. We were taught that the Bible was 100% fact, written by God through Human Agents.

I did not even find out that the Gospel was written years and years after Jesus's death, not by the original apostiles until after I moved away from the Church. We were taught that Peter was Peter in the stories.

Dave - my reponse was sooo long that it is becoming another article.

Suffice it to say, I do not bash Christianity - I bash black and white thinking, us vs them mentalities and blind faith.]]></wp:comment_content>

Is faith allergic to sunlight? If you cannot even question it with out breaking it, how strong is it?

	<p>My belief structure morphs over time - because I work it out. I pull it, twist it, and stretch it. It has not broken in a since I lost my faith in God. It was brittle and hard, and now it's elastic and strong. It just changes when presented with a new idea, or a new way of looking at something.</p>


	<p>I do not believe something because I read it or I am told it - I believe it because it makes logical and reasonable sense to me. I accept outside sources when I have several trusted authorities that corroborate each other. Or I try it. It's that simple. Meditation is good for mental stability say the Buddhists. I do not believe them, so I try it. Guess what, they are right. Good old empirical evidence.</p>


	<p>My belief is based on reasoning. True, it's the limited reasoning that I am capable of, but we have to work with the tools that we are given. If some one wants to be a Christian, I applaud them for their faith. Christianity has some really good teachings. However, I believe that they should know what they believe and why. Circular logical and superstition is not knowing what and why - it's taking the easy road out of the valley.</p>


	<p>When it comes down to it, one side said says '<em>it's true because I believe it and I believe it because it says it's True</em>' and the other side is asking '<em>why do you believe it, why is it true?</em>'. There is a huge disconnect in fundamental thinking between the two. One argument is grounded in reason, logic and evidence. The other is using superstition, tradition and blind faith. The problem is when the faith based folks also feel that they have the <strong>only</strong> truth available. They are not willing to allow others to believe differently then they do, or act differently then what they think is 'correct'.</p>


	<p>If you have faith, and you cannot even defend it with out dropping back on '<em>its true because I believe it</em>', should you be making moral choices for others? My concern is that a lot of people are trying to force their faith based moral choices on the rest of us. They feel that they have a manifest destiny to do this. Their faith gives them this manifest destiny. They might be a minority, but they are very vocal, and they are pushing legislation based on their black and white world-view.</p>


	<p>For example, does it really hurt someone to allow the Marriage of two people who love each other? According to some, it causes grievous harm in certain circumstances. So much harm that there are constitutional amendments being proposed that stop this from happening in these cases. This is an example of civil penalties for not following the faith based belief system of a certain religion. They do this because feel that they have a monopoly on <em>Truth</em>, and anyone who disagrees with their version of <em>Truth</em> is a sinner or heretic.</p>


	<p>In every part of life we accept that the world is not black and white, except religion. I have been told by preachers and priests that '<em>if you're not with us, you are against us</em>'. That is the kind of sick thinking that I try and debunk. And, yes, it's <strong>sick</strong>. It's a mimetic virus that is trying to make sure that it survives in a global survival of the fittest ideas war.</p>


	<p>What the people carrying this disease fail to understand is this war will only be lost.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;if some one wants to be a Christian, I applaud them for their faith.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The other is using superstition, tradition and blind faith.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;And, yes, it's sick.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Certainly these are bits taken out of context, but I don't think I am miss representing the overall thrust of this post.  It is hard to read such a thing, and place any trust on your assertion that your beliefs are based upon reason and logic, rather than an emotional 'faith.'

ObiDaveKenobi's point is, I think a valid one.  Why do you so frequently feel that you need to attack (and that is what it is) other people's faith?  I think that that says more about you, than it does about the belief system you are attacking.

As for gay marriage, either it is should be allowed or it should not.  Ends up being 'black and white' we can't really half allow it.  You have belief systems, which I highly doubt you could logically prove, that cause you to believe it is a good idea.  I tend to agree with you, but I am not so hubristic as to believe that I am right for sure.  Society is a complex system, and changing the rules of marriage will undoubtably have unpredictable results, some good, some bad.  Trusting in a belief system that has evolved over thousands of years, rather than having faith that human logic will be able to create a different and better order does not necessarily mean someone is foolish.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Yes, you are misrepresenting the thrust of the post. I rail against blind faith. If you cannot even back up your belief, then how solid is that belief? Cannot your belief stand being brought out into the sunlight and examined, or is it ephemeral, and will evaporate under scrutiny?

&lt;blockquote&gt;Why do you so frequently feel that you need to attack (and that is what it is) other people's faith?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To paraphrase an evangelical Christian preacher that was on a WaWa Walters special &quot;It's like seeing some one drink draino. You know it's not good for them, and you are going to try and get them to stop&quot;.

Unquestioning blind faith in anything or anyone is unhealthy. This is not a question of my belief that this is true, we have lots of evidence across the world that shows us beyond a shadow of a doubt, that this is true.

Also - if God did make us in his image, who are we to deny our questioning nature? Is debate about political ideology OK, but debate about faith verboten?

Making laws that forbid acts that are consenting, do not harm anyone, and between two adults is paramount to putting a gun to people's head to enforce a moral code that you believe in. I do not believe that Gay Marriage is a good idea for me, I would not participate in it. However, I do not want to deny others the freedom to make their own choices in that regard.

Is it right? Wrong? I have no idea. I &lt;b&gt;know&lt;/b&gt; that it's not right for me, however what gives me the right to force others to live by what I think? If there is a God, then is it not for him to judge them? If he gave us free will, is it really our place to force people to act in a fashion that we deem good?

Where I draw the line is when some one gets hurt, or their rights are reduced. Basically, I can sum up my political beliefs in one simple statement. &lt;i&gt;Everyone should have the right to do what ever they want, as long as they do not effect anyone else's right to do the same in any manner.&lt;/i&gt;

I fully understand that this is a Utopian vision, but we have to have goals, no? :)]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[You rail against blind faith, but what is faith without a component of blindness?  Faith is trust without proof.  You seem to demand 'proof' for everything, and anything less than that is 'blind faith.'  Given that, I cannot see the distinction you claim to make between faith and blind faith, unless perhaps in your world 'faith' does not inspire any action while 'blind faith' does.

I certainly think debate about faith, religion and whatever is great.  There is a difference between debate and mockery though.  Debate is not saying 'you are an idiot if you believe this.'

Gay Marriage is not of course about just two adults doing what they want.  That would be gay sex.  Marriage is, by definition, an acknowledgement of society of a special status for a particular relationship.  It clearly isn't just about 'two people.'  Isn't demanding that gay marriage be recognized just as much 'putting a gun to people's head' as demanding that it not be?]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I guess that I simply cannot understand faith with out any evidence at all. When I was a practicing Christian, I was blindly faithful. I had some internal constancy to what I believed (the Bible is literal telling of history, God has reasons for everything that happens). When I realised that the Bible was not a literal telling of history, that rocked my faith to the core.

I went through a long period of searching for answers - I tried Wicca, Agnosticism, Atheism, Drugs, Celtic Reconstructionism, etc. Everywhere I found parts of what I was seeking, but it was still all predicated on at least one leap of faith. To quote a Friend, 'anything that starts with &lt;em&gt;first we get a million dollars&lt;/em&gt; is suspect'.

When I read and understood the Koan 'What do you do when you meet the Buddha on a road? You kill him' - it was like a light bulb. A mini satori. Why leap, when you can keep your feet on the ground?

I do not think that I mock. People might take questioning their faith as mocking, but it's simple questioning. I am honestly interesting in the answers.

As far as a distinction between blind faith and faith... it's easy. The folks following Jim Jones had blind faith. If you question your faith, and come out the other side stronger, and more faithful, it's not blind faith.

We are not here to be lead about like sheep. We are here to learn, and improve ourselves. Only through self-doubt, questioning and introspection will we achieve that goal.

As far as gay marriage, perhaps we should not allow difference races to marry? It's basically the same thing.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;If you question your faith, and come out the other side stronger, and more faithful, it's not blind faith.&lt;/blockquote&gt;I get the impression that you feel that anyone that doesn't follow your path has not properly questioned their faith.  That seems extremely self centered to me.  Buhdism is logical and self-evident, Christianity is myth and superstition.  This is questioning or seeking to know, this is judging.

I have looked into Buhdism, frankly I find it neither logical nor very compelling, some if the core beliefs of Buhdism are pretty repellant to me.  I am glad that they work for you, but frankly I find it offensive for you to say it is simply logic to believe as you do.

I do not consider myself a Christian either, although Christianity fascinates me.  &lt;blockquote&gt;We are not here to be lead about like sheep. We are here to learn, and improve ourselves. Only through self-doubt, questioning and introspection will we achieve that goal.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Take that on faith do you?  I doubt it can be 'proven'.

As for different races being the same as different genders, I guess that would depend on if you think that gender is as arbitrary and signifigant as race.  I tend to think that girls are different than boys in signifigant ways, while races are primarily artificial constructs.  However, I would suppose that if race is the same sort of thing as gender, anyone who wasn't bisexual is the same as a racist.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Your impression cannot be farther from the truth. I feel that anyone who has faith probably has questioned it at times. I feel that healthy faith is questioned faith, so when the preacher pulls out the kool-aid, you might just have second thoughts.

&lt;blockquote&gt;I do not consider myself a Christian either, although Christianity fascinates me.

 &lt;i&gt;We are not here to be lead about like sheep. We are here to learn, and improve ourselves. Only through self-doubt, questioning and introspection will we achieve that goal.&lt;/i&gt;

Take that on faith do you? I doubt it can be 'proven'.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Honestly, no it's not on faith. Look at the people around you who have a deep and abiding happiness. Not the ones that put on the front, I am sure that if you know any people like this they stand out. The ones that are as an island in the storm of life. Are they the people who try and better themselves, or are they the people who live status quo? More then likely, they are the questioners. They are the people who try and make themselves the best people possible. They don't accept themselves for what they are, they try and better themselves. They do not do this by sitting on their laurels.

I, of course, have no idea what the ultimate goal of life is, if there is even one. I do know, however, that we all strive to be happy. We all work at not suffering as much as possible. By inference, then, that seems to be the defacto goal of most humans. To find comfort.

All religions teach a method of obtaining comfort. Of calming fears. I simply think that doubt and questioning should be encouraged, not repressed. If you accept something simply because a book tells you to, how strong is that faith? Would not faith that has been tested in the crucible of debate be stronger? Faith that has survived things such as Job's trials?

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Buddha advises seekers of truth not to accept anything merely on the authority of another but to exercise their own reasoning and judge for themselves whether a thing is right or wrong.&lt;/i&gt;

On one occasion the citizens of Kesaputta, known as the Kalamas. approached the Buddha and said that many ascetics and brahmins who came to preach to them used to exalt their own doctrines and denounce those of others, and that they were at a loss to understand which of those worthies were right.

&quot;Yes, O Kalamas, it is right for you to doubt, it is right for you to waver. In a doubtful matter, wavering has arisen,&quot; remarked the Buddha and gave them the following advice.

&quot;Come, O Kalamas, do not accept anything on mere hearsay (i.e. thinking that thus have I heard it from a long time). Do not accept anything by mere tradition (i.e., thinking that it has thus been handed down through many generations). Do not accept anything on account of rumours (i.e., by believing what others say without any investigation). Do not accept anything just because it accords with your scriptures. Do not accept anything by mere supposition. Do not accept anything by mere inference. Do not accept anything by merely considering the appearances. Do not accept anything merely because it agrees with your preconceived notions. Do not accept anything merely because it seems acceptable (i.e., should be accepted). Do not accept anything thinking that the ascetic is respected by us (and therefore thinking it is right to accept his word).

- Anguttara Nikaya I gradual sayings, Kalama Sutta&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;Buhdism is logical and self-evident, Christianity is myth and superstition.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Christianity supposes that a guy is born of a virgin, walked on water, and rose from the dead. He is coming back at the end of time to throw everyone that does not agree with him into a fiery pit, and rule for in a heaven for all time.

Buddhism talks about a psychology to be more happy. It involves trying to do good deeds, not get to emotionally attached to things, and take all things in moderation.

Some Buddhists believe in reincarnation, and other mystical stuff, however it is not necessary to follow their path to be a Buddhist. After all, the Buddha himself told us to question everything.

Which is more grounded in reason?

Note: THIS IS NOT AN ATTACK ON CHRISTAINITY. It's just a simple retelling of the facts. Grounded in reason is not always the best thing. If people belive that Jesus walked on water and rose from the dead, that's ok by me. I believe stranger things. However, you have to admit that Christianity is kind of 'out there'.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;You seem to demand 'proof' for everything, and anything less than that is 'blind faith.' - DaveJustus replying to Tsykoduk&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Dictionary.com, faith is,
&lt;blockquote&gt;Confident belief in the truth, value, or trustworthiness of a person, idea, or thing.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An example of this type of faith is something like having faith that air will be around for a long time.  You are confident that it will be around because you know truthfully that it is around now, and has been around in the past.

You can have faith in a person to do something for you because in the past they have always come through for you when needed.

Blind faith, on the other hand, is believing in something without any proof or track record.  Following the writings of people from long ago does not warrant faith, it warrants blind faith.  The exact religion is irrelevant.  Most man-made religions require blind faith because they offer you intangible hope for the exchange of your obedience to their laws, rules, or teachings.  It really is that simple.

By researching many religions throughout the world we see similar stories that have been created by humans used to explain things like their natural surroundings, their existence on this planet, and why they should be in power and control over what you do.

Have you ever spoke to someone who has quit smoking and now seems to be a zealot over their new found freedom from the nasty habit?  They are elated and wish to share their success and happiness with others.  Normally at the expense of making everyone else around them nutty in the process, especially people who still smoke.

I have undergone a similar transition when it comes to religion, and I think this is what is going on with Tsykoduk as well.  It's not that we enjoy 'bashingâ€ other religions, we just want people to learn exactly what being the follower of a religion means.

I feel that in a way following a religion you have not studied deep is slavery to an idea others made up a long time ago.  I continuously find it amazing that people refuse to learn about their own religious system, and are literally blind to its teachings without even knowing what they are agreeing to. To me, these people are blissfully ignorant.

Be Christian, Buddhist, Islamic, Wiccan, or whatever floats your boat, but actually study a learn what it is you're giving your life over to.  Many people attempt to discuss this topic based on how they have always lived or believed, not because they have any substantial proof to back up their religious choice.

Good intellectual discussions on religion intrigue me.  Poorly thought out religious mud-slinging does not.  I'm not a religious person (oh really, never would have guessed).  So unless you roll up your sleeves and bring out the big guns on why you believe how you do, there's no need to discuss religion with me.

My views are simple because after digging deep into a multitude of religions for the past 20 years or so, my belief is direct, and my resolution firm.  I will not follow anyone, or any religious doctrine, without good cause.  I have yet to find that cause, so my belief is in the natural world.  I place my dedication to those things that I can influence, and try to act as a positive force in this world.

At times this is sometimes interpreted as an attack on religion, because the religious folk get very offended if you point out the short comings of their belief instead of sitting down in their 'thinking chairâ€ and providing a well researched point of discussion on why I am incorrect in my observation.

Our freedoms are not to be taken lightly, I will defend to the death a persons right to believe and practice that belief any way they wish short of harming others.  You will never see me champion the cause of removing those rights.

When a religious zealot even whispers the possibility of preventing someone else from exercising their own rights, or attempts to force their belief system on others, then I take offense, and so should all of you who want to retain these rights.  I'm not just fighting for the freedom of Christians, but for Buddhists, Wiccans, and those who worship the Flying Spaghetti Monster.

Hmmm, perhaps I over-extended my two cents.]]></wp:comment_content>

It's not that we enjoy 'bashingâ€ other religions, we just want people to learn exactly what being the follower of a religion means.&lt;/blockquote&gt;This is exactly what I was talking about when I talked about this attacking behavior telling us more about the attacker, than the subject being attacked.

I tend to strongly dislike zealots of all sorts, whether they are anti-smoking zealots or anti-christian zealots.  Zealotism of the converted is often particularly virulent.

My observations lead me to the belief that people with religious convictions tend to be happier than other people.  Generally, the people with the strongest faith don't wear it on their sleeves, don't confront others about it, and don't constantly preach, they simply live according to their beliefs.  Do they question their faith?  Yes, most probably, but they also trust without complete proof.  They seem to me to be happier, and better, for it.

The notion that Christianity is mystical and Buhdism a construct of pure logic strikes me as an extreme distortion.  Certainly Siddartha's story if as full of magic and supernatural activities as Christ.  You claim that you can take all of that out, and the notion of reincarnation as still be following Buhdism, perhaps so.  I am skeptical that supernatural Buhdism and non Supernatural Buhdism are any more similar conceptually than Supernatural and non-Supernatural Christianity.  The forms may be similar, but the fundamental principles are decidedly different.

Buhdism without belief in reincartion seems to me to merely be pop-psychology with eastern terminology.  This is not to say it isn't a good way to live, it probably is, but the central substance of Buhdism seems to be missing.

As to whether it is logical or not, that could probably be debated.  I will note though that although science and logic have done many great things in many diverse fields, their accomplishments in psychology and sociol engineering leave a lot to be desired.  I would compare these fields to witch doctors, except that witch doctors seem to have been able to contruct stable societies with reletively descent amounts of personal satisfaction.

In the realm of human relationships, it doesn't strike me as illogical to put trust in ideas made up a long time ago that have stood the test of time.  Churches and religions are they way they are because they have worked in the past.  People are not so different now then were then, and throwing that all away because you cannot understand necessarily why it works (it is illogical) doesn't strike me as wisdom but as foolishness.

I don't say we shouldn't change and continue to evolve or societies and traditions, but history has shown us that those who believe they can throw everything old out and build a brave new world based upon logic create greater horrors than anything they intended to replace.  That is the sort of hubris I see demonstrated by Tsycho and Mystic.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[To ensure folks realize that Tsykoduk and I do not necessarily see things the same way either, I am not a Buddhist, nor plan on becoming one anytime soon.

I view all religious teachings as a great place to study and find profound knowledge about both myself, and the world around me.  That is where my interest ends.  Even though I do not buy into the whole hocus pocus of most religions, I do agree that there is much that can be learned from the intellectual study of the various tomes of religious writings.

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the realm of human relationships, it doesn't strike me as illogical to put trust in ideas made up a long time ago that have stood the test of time. Churches and religions are they way they are because they have worked in the past. People are not so different now then were then, and throwing that all away because you cannot understand necessarily why it works (it is illogical) doesn't strike me as wisdom but as foolishness.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I fully understand why churches and religions work.

Sometimes I feel that I understand the lure more then most.
Churches and religions have worked in the past because people needed hope and protection.  Let's not even get into the fact that often you would be imprisoned or killed if you did not follow the local religion of the area.  The comfort they provide now is the same as it was years ago.  People enjoy feeling safe and singing about hope and joy and the warm tingly feeling that there is more to life then...well...life.

Foolishness, in this case, is in the eye of the beholder.  Is it more foolish to see the truth of a situation, or to remain blissfully ignorant singing songs with blinders on?  I'm certain on this viewpoint we will forever agree to disagree.  ;)

&lt;blockquote&gt;I don't say we shouldn't change and continue to evolve or societies and traditions, but history has shown us that those who believe they can throw everything old out and build a brave new world based upon logic create greater horrors than anything they intended to replace. That is the sort of hubris I see demonstrated by Tsycho and Mystic. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Who's advocating throwing everything old out?  I would rather have the blissful masses continue to go to church.  Many folks have shown up there because they cannot deal with the harshness of reality.  I certainly don't want to pull the comforting rug out from under them and let them wander aimlessly in the streets.  That is when we would truly see chaos reign!

Enlightenment is not forced on others, they must find their own way to reality.  Sort of reminds me of the Matrix movie.  Some people would rather not know that there is no such thing as God.  They would be too scared to face such a world based in reality.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;You claim that you can take all of that out, and the notion of reincarnation as still be following Buhdism, perhaps so. I am skeptical that supernatural Buhdism and non Supernatural Buhdism are any more similar conceptually than Supernatural and non-Supernatural Christianity. The forms may be similar, but the fundamental principles are decidedly different.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I don't say that - Buddha says that.

&lt;blockquote&gt;On one occasion the citizens of Kesaputta, known as the Kalamas. approached the Buddha and said that many ascetics and brahmins who came to preach to them used to exalt their own doctrines and denounce those of others, and that they were at a loss to understand which of those worthies were right.

'Yes, O Kalamas, it is right for you to doubt, it is right for you to waver. In a doubtful matter, wavering has arisen,â€ remarked the Buddha...

- Anguttara Nikaya I gradual sayings, Kalama Sutta&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It's pretty simple. Buddha wants us to know - not just believe. We are supposed to try, probe, and question. We are not to take anything on simple faith. He has set out a pathway of incremental steps before us, and he knows that faith alone will not take us to the finish line. He and we know that if we take action number 1, we will get result number 1 because many people before us have tried it, and, most importantly, because we have tried it. Not because we believe that it will. We have the evidence before us.

&lt;blockquote&gt;history has shown us that those who believe they can throw everything old out and build a brave new world based upon logic create greater horrors than anything they intended to replace. That is the sort of hubris I see demonstrated by Tsycho and Mystic.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

First off, Buddhism is &lt;b&gt;older&lt;/b&gt; then Christianity. Secondly, I have never said that we need to get rid of Christianity, or any other belief system. Rather, I have said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If people want to believe in Christianity, I have no problem with that - however I do have a problem when they tell me that the Bible is The Truth.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To bring this back around, recall that the original post was about the lack of absolute truth. This lack of absolute truth leads us to realizing that we should not - cannot - take actions such as killing, imprisoning, or any other harsh treatment of others &lt;b&gt;simply based on their accepting a different truth&lt;/b&gt; then us.

However...

We have a belief that says things like &quot;John 10:8 All others who came before me were thieves and robbers. But the true sheep did not listen to them.&quot; and &quot;Luke 19:27 But those enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over themâ€”bring them here and kill them in front of me.&quot; and folks wonder why I am a little hesitant about thinking that the Bible is the one true truth out there. Love everyone, but kill those that do not agree with me? Not the loving happiness that we are lead to believe.


&lt;blockquote&gt;Buhdism without belief in reincartion seems to me to merely be pop-psychology with eastern terminology.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, it's pop-psychology with 2500 years of practice and tweaking to get it right.

&lt;blockquote&gt;This is not to say it isn't a good way to live, it probably is, but the central substance of Buhdism seems to be missing.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Not true. The central substance of Buddhism is learning to live correctly. Reincarnation is a very small part of Buddhism. Karma is a very large part of Buddhism, however it simply does not need Reincarnation to exist. If you do bad things, bad things tend to happen to you. Kinda simple and universal. Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.

I could also point out that Reincarnation is no more odd then the idea of our souls traveling to some far off place and being tortured for all time because we did not agree with someone, or going to some paradise and enjoying boredom for all time. Not even to mention that little place called Purgatory, which the Catholic Church just did away with. Seems they were mistaken about it existing.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Tsycho, I don't like to tell people their 'faith' is un authentic, and I hope you don't take this the wrong way.  I will equally acknowledge that I could be wrong.  My understanding of most Buddhist traditions though is that the central goal is nirvana, ending the cycle of life and rebirth and attaining blissful non-existence.

You claim that you can take this out of Buddhism and still be 'authentically Buddhist' and that Buddhism is a good way to live in the here and now regardless of whether reincarnation is true or not.  I don't doubt the second half of that, but I am skeptical of the first half.  There are people who believe in a similar fashion that you can take the resurection out of Christianity and still be Christian and it is a guide to a good way to live and can be demonstrated as such in the here and now.  Once again, the second half of such statements seems true, but the first half is undoubtably false in my opinion.  I have more knowledge of Christianity, is I can better evaluate that, but with what I know of Buddhism, it seems to me that withour reincarnation and nirvana, the rest is but a shell of the religion.

That doesn't necessarily mean it is worse than the original, it may in fact be better, but it clearly seems to me to be different, substantialy so.  As to whether it is 'authentic' that may not matter much.

However, it is undeniable that the story of Siddartha contains a ton of magic or miracles or what have you.

It is also clear to me that Buddha does as for faith.  His requirements for faith seem quite similar to me than Christs requirements as I understand them.  Not blind faith, but trust that is built upon as you trust some, find it confirmed and trust some more.  It is failure to have that initial trust, of unwillingness because of fear or pride to continue to believe what you know to be true that is condemned, not ignorance.  I don't think Buhhdism is so different in that.

When you take out what you don't like and keep what you do, for whatever reason, I find that to be inventing one's own 'religion' which is why to me, the Buhhdism of Tsykoduk and the Atheism of Mystic look similar to me.  In all fairness, my own religious/spiritual beliefs are a construct of myself, and similar as well.  The difference is that I seem less sure than either of you that I am 'right.'

It is obvious to me that some people who profess to be Christians do indeed distort the message of Christ dramatically.  Some, perhaps even many, are guilty in the ways that you describe.  My observations are that for the most part they suffer from too little faith rather than too much.  It is lack of faith that causes them to enforce their professed beliefs upon others.

I certainly don't claim that the concept of heaven or hell are less odd than reincarnation.  Indeed, it is the opposite claim, that they are similar is what I made.

As a final thought on that, I always liked C.S. Lewis's criteria for those that go to 'hell' in The Last Battle.  He said, and I paraphrase those who Aslan (Christ) did not please went into the shadow.  Note that that is very different those who did not please Aslan.  As for Heaven being boring, I see no reason to think that would be the case.]]></wp:comment_content>

The goal of a Buddhist is as varied as Buddhists are. Many are attempting to reach enlightenment. There is a lot of discussion about what enlightenment &lt;b&gt;is&lt;/b&gt;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is generally assumed that being a religious person entails believing certain things about the nature of oneself and reality in general that are beyond the reach of reason and empirical verification. What happened before birth, what will happen after death, the nature of the soul and its relation to the body: these are first and foremost religious questions. And the Buddha was not interested in them. &lt;/blockquote&gt;
--&lt;a href=&quot;http://westernchanfellowship.org/agnostic-buddhist.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Stephen Batchelor&lt;/a&gt;

If I had to buttonhole myself, I would say that I am a borderline Zen/Agnostic Buddhist. However, being that we are instructed to think for ourselves, make up our own minds and not just believe, I have the good fortune to be able to take the parts that I personally agree with right now and leave the rest behind.

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is also clear to me that Buddha does as for faith. His requirements for faith seem quite similar to me than Christs requirements as I understand them. Not blind faith, but trust that is built upon as you trust some, find it confirmed and trust some more. It is failure to have that initial trust, of unwillingness because of fear or pride to continue to believe what you know to be true that is condemned, not ignorance. I don't think Buhhdism is so different in that.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Buddha does not require anything from us. He stands at the start of a path, and waves you over. He tells you that this path is hard work, and hands you a map. You are free to take the first step. If you find that the first step worked for you, then you are free to travel on, or turn back. There is no book that claims to have universal Truth. There is no instruction to do anything to those that do not agree, other then to have the best life you can, and love them unconditionally.

&lt;blockquote&gt;In all fairness, my own religious/spiritual beliefs are a construct of myself, and similar as well. The difference is that I seem less sure than either of you that I am 'right.'&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There is no right and no wrong. Truth is not absolute, and is dependent on many things. In effect, you are not right. And you are right. It just depends on your point of view.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Dalai Lama uses a quaint expression in colloquial Tibetan: dzugu dzug-sa mindoo, which means literally: &quot;there is no finger-pointing-place.&quot; Or as we would say: &quot;there's nothing you can put your finger on.&quot; Again this does not imply that the thing in question does not exist at all. It simply exposes the fallacy of the deeply-felt, almost instinctive assumption that our self, the mind or anything else must be secured in a permanent, transcendental basis. Yet the uniqueness of a person's mind or identity, the uniqueness of a flower that's growing in the garden outside, does not require any kind of transcendent basis that's peculiar to that thing. Emptiness indicates how everything that comes about does so through an unrepeatable matrix of contingencies, conditions, causes, as well as conceptual, linguistic and cultural frameworks. Everything arises out of an extraordinarily complex combination of transient events that culminate, in this particular instance, in my saying these words to you.&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[With statements like &quot;The goal of a Buddhist is as varied as Buddhists are. Many are attempting to reach enlightenment. There is a lot of discussion about what enlightenment is.&quot;  One has to wonder if the term Buddhist actually has any meaning?  If everyone who is trying imperfectly to be happy is a Buddhist, then I suppose everyone could be considered a Buddhist.

And, to paraphrase the Incredibles, if everyone is a Buddhist then no one is.  The term becomes synonymous with 'person.'

I don't know how one can square that Batcherlor quote with the concepts of Nirvana and reincarnation that seem to be to be integral to the Buddha's message.

&lt;blockquote&gt;There is no right and no wrong. Truth is not absolute, and is dependent on many things. In effect, you are not right. And you are right. It just depends on your point of view.&lt;/blockquote&gt;That is of course an absolute statement.  It is also, undermines the claim that Buddhism is 'logical.'

&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;the task of the logician is the same: to advance an account of valid and fallacious&lt;/a&gt;.  If truth must always be subjective, than valid and fallacious have no meaning and logic is futile.  Any logical process that arrives at such a conclusion must either be incorrect, or inapplicable.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Look at it this way:

In Relativistic Physics, everything is determined by the observer's frame of reference. If you have observer X, traveling .75c in direction Y and he tosses a baseball at .99c in direction Y - he sees the baseball travelling away at .99c. It is his 'truth' that the ball is traveling at .99c in relation to him. Since his frame of reference is traveling at .75c, it would logically be traveling at 1.64c from an 'at rest' observer - but in fact, the at rest observer sees the ball traveling at .99c and the tosser traveling at .75c.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Hilary Putnam, building on a suggestion of W.V.O. Quine, argued that in general that the facts of propositional logic have a similar epistemological status as facts about the physical universe, for example as the laws of mechanics or of general relativity, and in particular that what physicists have learned about quantum mechanics provides a compelling case for abandoning certain familiar principles of classical logic: if we want to be realists about the physical phenomena described by quantum theory, then we should abandon the principle of distributivity, substituting for classical logic the quantum logic proposed by Garrett Birkhoff and John von Neumann.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
--&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic#Is_logic_empirical.3F&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;

Logically, what a person accepts as true will be dependent on many things - their culture, parents, mood, education, lack of sleep, frame of reference etc. For example, a Gallic Celt probably had some very different ideas about what is true and not true then a modern person. For him, his truth was probably more true then our truth. However, we would look at his beliefs and call them superstitious nonsense. Who is right? It really depends on the frame of reference.
&lt;blockquote&gt;In Buddhism, the realization of emptiness equates to the experience of nibbana  (nirvana) and therefore the cessation of suffering or dukkha. Crucial to the  sunyata doctrine is the notion that the world is made up of a stream of ever changing elements, dharmas. Rather than seeing these dharmas, we create concepts which approximate what is really there. The world as we see it, therefore, is ultimately illusory - a fabrication of mind. Mahayana philosophy sees truth as of being two kinds, conventional and ultimate. Conventional truth is the world as we normally see it; ultimate truth is the world as it really is. The two don't exactly adhere - the world of conventional truth is a world of appearances; the world of ultimate truth is sunyata.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
--&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://buddhism.about.com/library/weekly/aa120602a.htm&quot;&gt;About.com&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Sunyata:  Emptiness. The idea in Mahayana Buddhism that nothing has a self, soul or essence, that the world is made up of a stream of ever changing mental and physical phenomena.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
I would point out the following '&lt;em&gt;the realization of emptiness &lt;strong&gt;equates&lt;/strong&gt; to the experience of nibbana  (nirvana).&lt;/em&gt;' There are other Buddhists that feel as I do. The trappings of religion are useful for some, but are not mandatory for understanding Buddhism. I hate to put it this way, but superstitious and/or religious beliefs are useful as a crutch to some. It's like Wicca - all of the trappings that they use to do Magick are just crutches. You can still accomplish the end goal with out the circle, various toys and smelly stuff. Sometimes your conscious mind just needs something to keep it distracted while you can really get the stuff done.

I'm not saying that I am better then those that need that crutch - I still need crutches. I simply use different ones.]]></wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><span class="caps">NASA</span>'s Cassini spacecraft may have found evidence of liquid water reservoirs that erupt in Yellowstone-like geysers on Saturn's moon Enceladus. The rare occurrence of liquid water so near the surface raises many new questions about the mysterious moon.

	<p>"We realize that this is a radical conclusion-that we may have evidence for liquid water within a body so small and so cold," said Dr. Carolyn Porco, Cassini imaging team leader at Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colo. "However, if we are right, we have significantly broadened the diversity of solar system environments where we might possibly have conditions suitable for living organisms."</blockquote>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>With a crucially timed firing of its main engines today, <span class="caps">NASA</span>'s new mission to Mars successfully put itself into orbit around the red planet. </blockquote>

	<p>-<a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/MRO/news/mro-20060310.html"><span class="caps">NASA</span></a></p>


	<p>With the red planets ability to suck probes into oblivion, this is good news. This orbiter will give us a better look at Mars then we have ever had before. As Mars is a likely target for our next big push in exploration, this is an important first step.</p>


<blockquote>"Our spacecraft has finally become an orbiter," said <span class="caps">JPL</span>'s Jim Graf, project manager for the mission. "The celebration feels great, but it will be very brief because before we start our main science phase, we still have six months of challenging work to adjust the orbit to the right size and shape." </blockquote>

	<p>One of the things that I am really looking forward to is some of the pictures that this will give us. One of the cameras can send back over 700 mega-pixel images. There will be some great desktop pictures!</p>]]></content:encoded>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://greg.nokes.name/spirit/712/#comment-1587">Dave</a> posed this intresting question a few days ago, and I really wanted to highlight it and my response to it.
<blockquote>Let me ask you something else. In a simple paragraph, can you answer why I should follow Buddhism? What benefits it will give me and what I will miss out on if I don't?</blockquote>
You should not. You should follow what ever path your own feet lead you to. You should also see that other people's paths are just as valid as the one that you tread on. Religions are based on faith, which by definition is unprovable, so to assume that you know better then your neigbhor is silly. Acting on that assumption by forcing them to follow your beliefs is a special kind of Hubris.</p>


	<p>Honestly, I do not care if you worship God, Satan, The Flying Spaghetti Monster, Zeus, Bob, Eris or Dogbert. You can believe what ever you want, as long as you do not try and force me to believe as you do.</p>


	<p>Note the use of the word Force. That's important.</p>


	<p>So, in an earlier <a href="https://greg.nokes.name/spirit/buddhism/680/">post,</a> I expounded on a way of looking at reality and the universe that depends on your internal filters. To sum up, there are three universes. The real external universe, the universe of what you perceive and the universe of how you comprehend what you perceive. You cannot directly interact with or perceive the outermost real universe, because of the time delay between when something emits a signal and when that signal makes it back through your sense receptors and sense processors to your subconscious.</p>


	<p>Your interaction with the middle universe is tenuous at best, as everything that comes out of your signal processors in your subconscious is filtered through the interface between your subconscious and conscious minds. Your culture, perceptions, upbringing and everything else 'spins' the data slightly and then presents it in the altered fashion.</p>


	<p>Since we cannot interact with anything more then an approximation of the real universe, to say that there is some ultimate truth that I or You or We have is an untenable platform. Ultimate truth should be able to be proved with empirical experience. However, most of the ultimate truths that I have seen bandied about are beliefs. Things like 'God/Allah/Zeus is real, powerful and good' or 'it is a universal truth that sentient beings should be free to act according to their own consciousness'.</p>


	<p>Neither of these statements will pass any evidentiary tests.</p>


	<p>Back to force. If these 'universal' truths cannot pass any evidentiary tests, and are in fact nothing other then closely held belief structures, might others feel differently? If there is that possibility, then forcing your beliefs on others seems to be a might bit silly, since <a href="http://www.answers.com/belief&#38;r=67">beliefs</a> cannot be <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&#38;ct=res&#38;cd=7&#38;url=http%3A//www.rcpsych.ac.uk/college/sig/spirit/publications/levy_01_jun_03.pdf&#38;ei=qekaRInVD56CYdDgndQO&#38;sig2=FPGo_HnEq0vHQYPYEDHRUA">proved.</a></p>


	<p>So, in summary -</p>


	<p>if belief  truth &#38;&#38; belief  proof
then
universal_truth = 1
else
universal_truth = 0
end</p>]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I would note that if we cannot know anything certain about the real universe, then by definition we cannot know for certain that we cannot know things for certain.

The problem I have with this whole line of logic is at some point belief has to be translated into action or it is meaningless.  We also have an interdependant society, and we have to force others to behave in certain ways for that to work.   I believe pretty strongly that we should do the minimum forcing that is required, but it seems to me that some force is needed.

For example, we believe that education of our children is an important community value and therefore we force everyone to pay for it, whether they agree or not.

Saying we shouldn't 'force others to believe as we do' if taken to the extreme means we cannot have any government or laws, which would of course result in many people forcing others to do what they want them to do.

We must choose what we value, and, where appropriate, advocate its promotion in our society.  In some cases that will necessiate the use of force.  At its most basic, we generally advocate the use of force to prevent/punish others from using force (police using force to stop a murderer for example.)

It think that your statement that you believe everyone should follow their own path is partially disingenuous.  You have written quite a few posts that more or less can be boiled down to Christianity is foolish while Buddhism is good.  Now, I perfectly accept that you don't want to force anyone to embrace Buddhism, but it seems to me that you would happily encourage people to embrace, or look into Buhhdism, and, as you are a generally descent person I imagine that you do so because you believe it would benefit them to do so.

Maybe I am wrong about that, but no other explanation seems to fit what I know about you.  I was not hostile in my question, I sincerely wanted to know what benefits you think a person in general would get from Buhhdism and why they should, at the very least, investigate it.]]></wp:comment_content>

&lt;p&gt;This statement was not meant to be taken to the extreme, and I'm fairly certain we all realize that we need laws and rules so that we can all play nice together in this huge sandbox of ours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It think that your statement that you believe everyone should follow their own path is partially disingenuous. - Dave Justus&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dave, you just contradict this statement by saying,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I perfectly accept that you don't want to force anyone to embrace Buddhism, but it seems to me that you would happily encourage people to embrace, or look into Buhhdism... -Dave Justus&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Encouraging, discussing, or teaching folks about what you believe is not the same approach as getting onto school boards to mandate teaching Buddhism in the classroom, or changing the pledge to read, 'One nation, under Buddhaâ€.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lonsberry.com/writings.cfm?go=4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Bob Lonsberry's article&lt;/a&gt; this morning where he talks about his son and the mission his son went on in Mexico.  Even though I don't really agree with the Mormon religion, I applaud the fact that they do these missions to spread their teachings to others.  I think it's great that these young folks go out and experience the world and help give others hope.  The Mormons definitely know how to do religion right.  They encourage large families, close bonds to their temples, and missions to spread the word of their religious beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do I want to force Mormons to renounce their religion and become atheists?  No.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like to talk about my views on religion.  Not because I am trying to convert the world, but because I am fascinated by the subject matter. Discussion and zealotry are not synonymous.

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;It think that your statement that you believe everyone should follow their own path is partially disingenuous. You have written quite a few posts that more or less can be boiled down to Christianity is foolish while Buddhism is good.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I feel that everyone should be allowed to believe as they see fit. I also do not feel that folks should be allowed to force others to ape their beliefs. However, I &lt;b&gt;never&lt;/b&gt; said that folks should not discuss their feelings about others beliefs - some times in spirited manners.

It's only through the crucible of discussion that we can truly come to understand who we are, and what we really believe.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The problem I have with this whole line of logic is at some point belief has to be translated into action or it is meaningless.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This line of logic says nothing about action, other then to not force others. You can take actions that you believe to help situations, such as donating time and or money to aid efforts, or what ever.

The real difference is I do not believe that Force works in the long run. If you want everyone to become Christian, or Muslim, or Buddhist, you need to show them why it would behoove them to make these choices. If you want folks to stop drinking or smoking or driving too fast, it's an education thing. If you simply make it illegal, folks that do not care about the law will continue to commit these acts which you find offensive.

In your case of education of children, I think that rather then forcing everyone to pony up 'their fair share' for a monolithic force fed solution, we should allow the parents to choose what they think is best for their children. Some will make bad choices - but that is their freedom. Their freedom to make their own choices based on what they believe.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Saying we shouldn't 'force others to believe as we do' if taken to the extreme means we cannot have any government or laws, which would of course result in many people forcing others to do what they want them to do&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I disagree. If I cannot force you to believe as I believe, then you cannot force me to do the same. Government exists to assure us that our rights are sacrosanct. They exist to assure us that no one takes away from us. At least, that is what I believe and I vote. :)]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;If you want everyone to become Christian, or Muslim, or Buddhist, you need to show them why it would behoove them to make these choices.&lt;/blockquote&gt;I agree.  Which is why I wonder why you haven't answered the question that started this post.

As for using of force, there are of course many people in the world who believe using force is a legitimate means to accomplish their ends.  It seems to me that the only effective means of stopping that is using force as well.  Because force is, by nature, a dangerous technique to employ we construct rules for legitimate and illigetimate uses for force.  One, although not the only, condition for the legitimate use of force is that it be employed by Government.  Hence, it is ok to have cops use force against mafia members who use force to extort money.  The first use of force is legimate in most peoples minds, the second is not.

We generally consider it ok to use for to provide for necessary government functions as well.  If you don't like the school example (which puts you in a minority) then perhaps you support taxes to pay for the police.  However, without the use for force to collects taxes (and it is certainly there) there would be no police. Force is something that we will either use, or we will be at its mercy when it is used against us.

Using force of course, without being corrupted by it, is  perhaps the greatest moral challenge.  It is not a challenge that can be avoided though.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[If a Jr. Highschooler asked you what he would get out of college, could you give him an valid answer beyond 'an education'? I could not. I would need to know what college, if he was going to party or study, what major, etc...

There are lots of schools of Buddhism - everything from Zen Buddhism to Tibetan Buddhism and Agnostic Buddhism. There are several core beliefs; live right and be somewhat happier, introspection is a very good path to enlightenment, enlightenment is a 'good thing', the Buddha was enlightened.

Buddhism is not a perfect path - it is flawed by the very pilgrims on it's path. However, I feel that it's teachings are more direct, and less encumbered by mysticism then most other spiritual paths.

While in a store today, I saw a refrigerator magnet that really summed it up for me &quot;&lt;i&gt;People who are spiritual inspire me, People who are religious frighten me&lt;/i&gt;&quot;. I think that this statement really cuts to the core of what I am trying to say.

&lt;blockquote&gt;   &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.answers.com/religious&amp;r=67&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;reÂ·liÂ·gious (rÄ­-lÄ­j'É™s)&lt;/a&gt;
adj.

   1. Having or showing belief in and reverence for God or a deity.
   2. Of, concerned with, or teaching religion: a religious text.
   3. Extremely scrupulous or conscientious: religious devotion to duty.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

vs.

&lt;blockquote&gt;In recent years, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirituality&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;spirituality&lt;/a&gt; in religion often carries connotations of the believer's faith being more personal, less dogmatic, more open to new ideas and myriad influences, and more pluralistic than the faiths of established religions. It also can connote the nature of a believer's personal relationship with God, as opposed to the general relationship with Deity understood to be shared by all members of that faith.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One tends to be open and understanding, and the other tends to be closed and not open to new ideas. I believe that this closedness is in fact a part of the problems that we are having in the world today. People hate each other to much. People fling stones, or stomp off in a huff when their sacred cows are discussed.

The only way out of this, in my eyes, is to teach understanding and love for our fellow beings. Right now, we need the threat of force to cause a large portion of the populace to act reasonably. I believe that threat of force could be lessened by simple education in tolerance, understanding and morality.

Those three have to go hand in hand. If we do not teach understanding and tolerance, then the morality goes out the window when we meet some one different then us.

Tolerance is taught by teaching us to love one and another. Understanding is taught by learning about what other people feel and do. Morality is simple right and wrong.

I can hear it now - I do not believe in universal truth, how can I espouse a moral system? Easily. It's not universal. Communities should be formed where their morals can be taught, with the understanding that others feel different then they do, and that is acceptable.

Sounds like utopia? I really do not think that we will get there. However, just because a goal is hard to reach, should we not even try?]]></wp:comment_content>

<blockquote><a href="http://www.damninteresting.com/?p=479">Centralia, Pennsylvania</a> was never a particularly large community, but it was once a lively and industrial place. At its peak the coal mining town was home to 2,761 souls, but today the population of its cemeteries far outnumbers that of its living residents. The series of events which led to the community's demise, slowly diminishing its numbers to less than a dozen, began about forty-four years ago.

	<p>In 1962, workers set a heap of trash ablaze in an abandoned mine pit which was used as the borough's landfill. The burning of excess trash was a common practice, yet at that particular time and place there existed a dangerous condition: an exposed vein of anthracite coal. The highly flammable mineral was unexpectedly ignited by the trash fire, prompting a quick effort to put it out. The flames on the surface were successfully extinguished, but unbeknownst to the fire fighters, the coal continued to burn underground.</blockquote></p>]]></content:encoded>

	<p><em>Larry Hothem, project leader for <a title="geodetic science" href="http://everything2.com/index.pl?node=geodetic%20science">geodetic science</a> for the <a title="United States Antarctic Program" href="http://everything2.com/index.pl?node=United%20States%20Antarctic%20Program">United States Antarctic Program</a> at the <a title="South Pole Station" href="http://everything2.com/index.pl?node=South%20Pole%20Station">South Pole Station</a> said: "There's been a couple <a title="stolen" href="http://everything2.com/index.pl?node=stolen">stolen</a>. I know the 1994 marker is missing." </em></p>


	<p>The pole marker is a stainless steel rod about 10' long with a large brass head four to six inches in diameter, machined by craftsmen each year to commemorate another year of human habitation. Each year a new one is made and placed in the spot that is exactly geographically 90 degrees south, where all the longitude lines merge. The old ones, barring theft, are left in place. There would be a long line of them. Each is unique, having been designed by the winter-over team from the prior year. (There are about 200 inhabitants of south pole station in the summer, and only 50 support staff and scientist "winter overs" to keep things going during the dark season.)</blockquote>

So I will let people make the best choices that they can. If they choose to do things that are, in my opinion, ethically wrong, I cannot judge them. I have not travelled in their shoes, and I do not know their mindset nor what caused them to make that choice.</p>


	<p>When thinking about forcing your opinion and religion upon others, recall the following :</p>


	<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.blueletterbible.org/Mat/Mat007.html">Matthew 7:1,2</a> "Judge not, that ye be not judged. For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again."</p>


	<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/Jhn/Jhn008.html#2">John 8:7</a> "So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her."</p>


	<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.members.shaw.ca/mioko/EightFoldPath.htm">Thunder Bay Buddhist Fellowship</a>: "We must be ever mindful of our actions. We must live in awareness. Are we filling our mind with angry judgmental thoughts, which will impact the way we treat others? Or are we cultivating empathy toward those around us?"</p>]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[All of those arguments could be applied to murder, as well as abortion.  If we can't judge abortion, why can we judge murder?

I don't think that most abortion is murder, although very late term abortions draw quite close to that line, but I do think that the 'we can't judge' argument is falacious unless you want to apply it across the board (and that would be a horrible mistake.)

Better arguments have to be constructed as to why abortion should be legal than that.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Not to pick nits - but there is a huge difference between murder and abortion - just in the fact that people disagree on if abortion is in fact murder. There is no clear cut anything when dealing with it.

My point was more broad then simply abortion. Abortion is just an example of certain people feeling 'justified' in taking actions that remove freedom from others. Is abortion right or wrong? I really don't know. Will there ever be a preponderance of evidence one way or the other? Perhaps, but right now it's a gray area. Grey areas are where we, as advanced beings, make choices. With out the freedom to choose as we see fit, what do we become?

We could make and enforce all of the laws to create a society where no one was offended, where no one's morals were impinged. What a boring place to live!]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I don't disagree that there is a difference between abortion and murder.  What I don't see, and this point is broader than simply abortion as well, is how you can say that we can't judge things that are ethically wrong, if you still want to maintain any sort of society.

In both murder and abortion, their are people who think that that behavior is ethically wrong.  Their are also those who disagree with that view (in the case of murder, the number is much smaller but not zero.)  Saying we cannot judge one doesn't make sense to me.

We have to judge both what behaviors we should personally engage in, and what behaviors society should prohibit.

I don't think that 'gray areas' are the demarkation between what should be legal and illegal.  The vast majority of people consider lying to be wrong, it is not a 'gray area' in that sense, but in only very specific circumstances do we consider lying to be a crime.  This isn't because it is 'gray' it is because most of us consider that the harm that would be done by trying to enforce such a thing, and the degradation of freedom that results would outweigh any benefit.  One the other side of things, most people don't consider drug use to be a gray area either, and are happy to support it being a crime.  I think that is a mistake, not because it is gray (I don't reommend drug use at all) but because it (by itself) doesn't directly harm anyone else, only the user.

We must judge.  Hopefully we will judge wisely, and with a degree of humility, but saying we can't judge as a base principle is crazy in my opinion.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I guess that we are using different definitions of 'judge'. To judge some one has very serious negative connotations in my mind, and in the context of the quotes I used.

My judging of a action that I preform inherent rightness or wrongness, is of course part of life.

For me, Judging means to look down upon, to think less of some one because of the actions that they take. We are all guilty of doing this - after all how can you not think less of a suicide bomber then a Mother Theresa?

What we need to strive towards is a world where we would be able emote the same &lt;em&gt;agape&lt;/em&gt; towards all people, even the suicide bombers.

If I see that suicide bomber trying to harm others, I will, of course, attempt to stop him. However, that does not mean that I should hold &quot;&lt;em&gt;angry judgmental thoughts&lt;/em&gt;&quot; towards him.

When I was taking Kendo, one of the things that was stressed repeatedly was to act from calm. Not to let emotion sway or grip you. Disregard your fear, anger and triumph. Exploit those emotions displayed in your foe's face.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[In your original post, you argued against applying legal penalties for certain actions, because doing so damages individual freedom and constitutes judging others.

Although you have not expressly stated this, I think you agree, that there should be legal penalties for murder.

You have provided no means of differentiating murder (or any other act that has legal penalties you support) from acts that you don't think should have legal penalties.

Limiting freedom and judging would, apply equally to both types, which is why (unless you advocate complete anarchy) this argument is useless in determining what should be legal and what should be not.

Of course a successful suicide bomber has moved beyond legal punishment, but if we change the example to a una-bomber type killer, I certainly think that legal penalties should apply to his actions.

While we should probably love everyone, even the una-bomber, and not judge the state of their soul, I would not advocate translating that moral principle into not applying legal penalties to him.  We should judge him, and apply penalties as a response to his actions.

You gave two quotes in your original post from the New Testament.  I think that there is some difficulty in applying some of the words of Christ to what a just government should do.  Christ was not particularly concerned about earthly governance, his most pithy quote on the subject is 'render unto Caesar that which is Caesar's' which I don't think we can take to mean that the Roman government at the time was the model of what a good government should be (or even that Roman tax policies were fair.)  Jesus didn't govern a nation, and we don't really have a good idea of what he would have done if he did.

This has given Christian philosophers a lot of trouble over the years, with a variety of solutions.  Almost all though seem to agree that a 'Christian Government' would be unjust if it behaved like a Christian individual.

Similar difficulties exist with Buddhist pacifism, as you are no doubt aware, with various Buddhist governments over the centuries trying to square to obvious need of a government to have a monopoly on the use of force and to defend its citizens with pacifism.]]></wp:comment_content>

Yup. And I stand by that. If an action does not effect another person's rights, folks should be allowed to make up their own minds about how to proceed.

With the specific case of Abortion - the 'grey' area is if a person is in fact harmed. What makes it a grey area - there is no preponderance of evidence that we could point to and say 'side A is right!'

With Murder, on the other hand, it is very easy to see if a person is harmed. There is no grey about it.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The harm principle is not a bad way to think about what should be legal or illegal and I tend to agree with it in many cases.  I am not convinced that it is the only principle we should ever apply, but I think anything else requires great care.

It has nothing to do with not being 'judgemental' or 'limiting freedom' though.

Outlawing murder limits my freedom just as much (perhaps more) as outlawing abortion.  Both require similar amounts of judging anothers action.

There have of course been times when murder didn't seem so easy to many people.  Killing a slave or an indian for example.  This was excused because the victim wasn't really a 'person.'

This makes me somewhat uncomfortable with the current arguments that a fetus isn't a person.

On the other hand, pregnancy does involve specific and considerable intrusion on the body of the woman carrying the fetus.

To return to my point in all of this though, I don't necessarily have an issue with your view on abortion.  I have an issue with saying we can't outlaw abortion because that would be 'judgemental.']]></wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>According to a University of Minnesota survey in the April issue of the American Sociological Review, atheists are the least trusted minority in the U.S., less trusted than Muslims, recent immigrants and gays and lesbians.

	<p>The survey suggests that many Americans still associate atheism with immorality, an association motivated by the old canard that ethics necessarily depends on religion, that you can't be good without God...</p>


	<p>..Perhaps most egregiously, atheists (and their children) have suffered at the hands of family courts. In an essay that will appear in the May issue of the New York University Law Review, <span class="caps">UCLA</span> law professor Eugene Volokh provides evidence that courts have discriminated against atheists in custody disputes.</p>


	<p>Volokh, who also runs the insightful weblog <a href="http://volokh.com/">The Volokh Conspiracy</a>, documents examples of anti-atheist discrimination in 17 states (including New York, Connecticut, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and many southern states) and the District of Columbia.)</p>


	<p>- (<a href="http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/columnists/story.html?id=92ae2eb3-7d80-42b9-befb-7a207192f1f1&#38;p=1">The Vancouver Sun</a>)</blockquote>
It's a really good read..</p>]]></content:encoded>

You can be moral without religion. You can be amoral with religion. It would seem to me that morality and religion are two separate entities. The idea that you can only learn to be good through God is poppycock.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Poppycock.  Good word, good point.  I totally agree, and it doesn't help that I went from a relatively &quot;tolerant&quot; religious environment (Vermont) to the country in Maryland.  The people here absolutely equate your morality with your attendance on Sunday.  I have a hard time avoiding religion in even casual conversation here.  Then, when I say &quot;agnostic&quot; (which is, in their minds, atheism) I get a deer-in-the-headlights stare.

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[To an extent, I think you can always find intolerance and discrimination if you look for it.  I don't think that there is in fact much intolerance toward atheism in America.

The family courts may be an injustice, but religious upbringing of children after a divorce is often contentious and it is difficult subject to deal with.  I won't go into that particular issue here.

Tolerance though does not require agreement or approval.  An atheist can still be tolerant toward a religious person while believing they are misguided and foolish.  Indeed, an atheist could not feel any other way.  The reverse is true as well.

Certainly some of this will slip over into 'unfairness' if looked at from a certain perspective.  I would imagine that in a nation where 3 percent of the populace was religous, and the rest were atheist, the society would look down upon the religious minority, as the widespread belief that those religious people were foolish and misguided would prevail and be reinforced by the majority.

Does this mean that they are 'intolerant'?  I don't know that it does.]]></wp:comment_content>

Hmmm..

Bush&lt;/a&gt; &quot;&lt;i&gt;I don't know that atheists should be regarded as citizens, nor should they be regarded as patriotic.  This is one nation under God.&lt;/i&gt;&quot; really concern me.

I agree that tolerance does not require agreement. However, it does require fair treatment, compassion and understanding.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[In 2000, John McCain called Falwell an 'agent of intolerance,' arguably that is an accurate description, but just as arguably it could be considered intollerant of Falwell and his supporters.  Does that make evangelical christians a persecuted group?

Certainly their are people who dislike or distrust atheists.  I haven't seen any attempts to strip the of citizenship or send them to re-education camps or anything like that.  I am not aware that atheists have lower income potential because of intolerance (indeed I have seen it argued that atheists on average are better off than most other groups.)  I personally don't agree with, or support the statement G.H.W. Bush made above.

I certainly agree with you that tolerance requires fair treatment.  I am not sure that it requires compassion or understanding though.  This is not to say that comapassion and understanding are not good things, but simply not a requirement for tolerance.  I don't have to understand why someone is an atheist, or feel compassion toward them being an atheist, I simply have to accept that they can be an atheist if they want, and that atheism should not confer any legal penalties despite any disapproval I may have for that choice.  If I do that, I am tolerant.  If I don't I am not.

Of signifigance, I think a person can be tolerant of atheism (or anything else), but choose not to associate with atheists.  They are still tolerant.

People seldom really want to be tolerated however, what they want is to be accepted and approved of, which is a different thing entirely.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[In the linked article, they say &quot;&lt;i&gt;Perhaps most egregiously, atheists (and their children) have suffered at the hands of family courts. In an essay that will appear in the May issue of the New York University Law Review, UCLA law professor Eugene Volokh provides evidence that courts have discriminated against atheists in custody disputes.&lt;/i&gt;&quot;.

My concern is that harm is being done because of religious preference, or lack there of. As a society, the U.S. claims that we are 'the good guys', what ever that means. We claim that we are pro-freedom. However, when our actions and the actions of our legal system show otherwise, there is a very large disconnect.

We vehemently protested the possible execution of a Muslim turned Christian, and yet we turn a blind eye to courts judging against atheist parents &lt;i&gt;solely based on their lack of religion&lt;/i&gt;?]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I understand that concern, and as I mentioned above I can see it being a possible injustice.

Custody disputes are a tricky thing though.  Their major purpose is not justice for either of the parents but the best interests of the child.  This is of necessity going to be at least partially subjective.  It will not always be 'fair' to the parents involved.

I don't claim that atheists are not good parents.  Indeed, I would be happier if the bias Volokh has identified did not exist.  In a perfect world, the religion of the parents would probably not enter into it.

The morality of the parents might be a valid question to ask though.  And it is true that some people will equate religious belief with morality.  Even more likely, I can see religious and community activity being evidence of moralityand that would put athiests at a disadvantage at times.

If we have two parents, all else being equal, and one is a member of a charitable religious group doing good works and the other is not, I can see a Judge not being biased against atheists per se choosing to award custody to the first.  Of course the second may in fact be the more moral person, and do many good works in private while the first is merely involved for the ostentatious display of it all.

Another way this could be 'unfair' but not an obvious bias is if we look at evidence of what each parent does with the child.  Both parents take the child to sporting events perhaps, and other neutral events but only one takes the child to religious activities.

Sometimes, statistics can't tell you a lot about what is going on.  I haven't seen Volokhs evidence, so I can't evaluate it although I have a lot of respect for him and trust that if he says there is a statistical difference in outcomes for atheists and non-atheists I imagine it exists.

I do seem to recall though that male atheists are more common than female atheists.  If this is correct, then given that we know judges tend to prefer to grant custody to women over men, bias against atheists in a family court could be an artifact of this.

Regardless, it seems to me that family court bias is a pretty small thread to hang any great claims of systematic bias.  As I stated, family courts are purposed not primarily on justice for the claiments, but best interests of the child.  If we had evidence of similar bias in other court situations that would be a cause for much more concern.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I disagree.

Faith is belief in a truth which cannot be proven. It is not the job of the folks who do not believe to prove why they should not believe, it's up to the folks that believe to show why others should agree with them.

If &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; truth is so compelling that you have no problem in following it, they why does every one else not see what you can?

To put my chestnuts in the fire, as it were, I do have certain beliefs - and probably some would say a faith in certain things. I would answer that question with &quot;Others are not as smart as I am&quot;. I do not mean to sound condescending, however I do not think that what I see as truth is self evident. It has taken me a lot of years and a lot of explorations in religious theories and practice, a lot of self searching and questioning and a lot of pondering. With out that footwork, I do not believe that I would hold the truths that I do.

Faith that is put to the test of questioning and searching is stronger then faith that is read out of a book.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[If you did not mean to be condescending you failed.

It is true that a religious person would have to answer the question 'why don't others believe what I do?' with an 'I don't know'.  I think it is just as true for a non-religious person.

For some religious people, their faith gives them guidlines as to why that might be.  Some feel that only certain people will recieve faith, others that unless a person seeks faith they will not be able to find it, some would simply conclude that nonbelievers are unwilling to accept God.

One could make other parallels.  Why do some people like Star Wars Episode I when others don't?  Why do some people like country music?

Many people have of course reported that they have tested the faith that they hold and feel strongly that they have recieved confirmation of it.  It is unarguable that they have different views on what exactly that means and what message God or the Gods have for us.

The story of the blind men and the elephant seems to fit here.

Atheists (and Buhdists who don't believe in any supernatural powers) of course deny that the elephant exists at all.  Perhaps they do in fact see clearer.  It is equally possible though that they are blind a also leperous and unable to feel, that they have simply not felt where the elephant is yet, or perhaps most likely, they refuse to feel around to see if an elephant is there at all.

After all, if you are in a room with an elephant, it does limit your ability to feel like you are the biggest thing in the room.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;One could make other parallels. Why do some people like Star Wars Episode I when others don't? Why do some people like country music?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Matters of taste. If you claim that there is a universal truth (a belief that I do not hold), following that truth is not a matter of taste.

If Religion is simply a matter of taste, then why get worked up if others feel differently then you about it? After all, does it upset you that others prefer lemon-pecan pie, when you do not? Should you pass laws to restrict others from eating said pie? Behead them?

I think that most of the world feels that religion is a little more then a simple question of taste, or preference.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Atheists (and Buhdists who don't believe in any supernatural powers) of course deny that the elephant exists at all.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I assume that was pointed in my direction :). Perhaps it's because we see the entire elephant? Perhaps by being detached from the emotional undertones of Religion, we can see reality for what it really is? I don't know. I just try and do the best that I can with the tools that I have. Questioning is a big part of my tool chest. After all, if we did not question, would we have developed computers?

When I question Religion, I do not get answers that satisfy me. I get a lot of fluff, telling me to 'just believe and it will all make sense later'. When I ask pointed questions about 'how it works'  I am told that 'we cannot understand that, it's beyond us'. However, Quantum Physics was once beyond our ken, but now we have a pretty good handle on it.

Personally, I do not accept 'we cannot understand it' as any kind of acceptable answer. It's a copout.

&lt;blockquote&gt;After all, if you are in a room with an elephant, it does limit your ability to feel like you are the biggest thing in the room&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Honestly, I do not care about being big or powerful. If there is a God, then I will stand in judgement with my head held high - I stand by what I say. It's not perfect, it might not even be true, but it's what I see as correct, with the knowledge and experience that I have. It's what I have done. If God requires blind obedience, then S/He should not have created us with free will.

I might have an epiphany tomorrow, and everything might change. Who knows? I certainly do not.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The point with movies and music is that people percieve things differently.  You can call it a 'matter of taste' but that doesn't really explain why it occurs, it is a label without a distinction.

Yes, the Buhdist comment is directed at you as a Budhist who believes in supernatural powers, such as fill the story of Siddartha, would have a very different interpretation of things.  It was certainly not meant to be an attack, simply pointing out that you are similar to an atheist in this regard.

I think you should decide which it is, don't you know or are you smarter than other people.

We have went back and forth on questioning before.  I concede that some religious people, and some religions disprove of questioning.  However, certainly not all do.  Most religious people I am aware of believe questioning is a good thing and that everyone needs to develop personal faith, questioning is part of that process.

However, part of faith is obediance without full understanding.  If God says 'where purple on thursdays' it is not necessary to know why purple on thursday is good, simply that one trusts God, and has faith that following his guidance is for the best.  Quantum Physics is still way beyond by ken, but I have faith that when some really smart people say the universe seems to work this way, they are not totally wrong (Obviously they don't understand everything so they are probably partially wrong.)

I don't see that a God that expects obediance is incompatible with a God that created free will.  If there was no free will, obediance (a concious choice to obey) would be impossible.  Free will is necessary for obediance.

The biggest thing in the room comment wasn't directed at you personally.  It does seem to me though that some atheists are motivated by that impulse.  Pride seems to prevent them from having faith.  I myself have faults along those lines, but I am not inclined to brag that it is a strength, instead I suspect it may be a weakness.

As to how our faith should inform our political processes, that is a complex thing and different religions (and non-religious philosophies) have very different answers.  I am inclined to follow, as I think are you the 'harm' principle and leave matters of conscious to individuals.  Many with strong faith agree, some obviously do not.  However, the most contentious of the social policy debates along those lines, abortion, doesn't fit easily into this principle.

As an asside, it seems pretty clear to me that believing that there is no universal truth, is just as 'faith based' as anything else.  It is also of course self contradictory.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[There is no evidence for or against a universal truth. Therefore, it is up to what some would call faith. However, my beliefs are grounded in a reasonable, logical deduction based on what circumstances there are around me. Others might perceive things differently then I do - and that's OK, as long as they do not try and force their beliefs onto me, or anyone else who does not wish to believe the way that they do.

They might believe that there is some super reality where the essential tree lives - and from their point of view they might be very grounded in believing that.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Blind obedience/blind faith; bad idea. I agree with that assertion as well. Though some confuse 'blind faithâ€ with trust, and they are not the same thing.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

True, true. I define Trust as a slowly built understanding that some one or something will be act in a certain manner. Blind Faith, I define as &quot;&lt;i&gt;Belief without evidence in what is told by one who speaks without knowledge, of things without parallel. &lt;/i&gt;&quot; (the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.answers.com/library/Devil's%20Dictionary-cid-2093737035&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Devil's Dictionary&lt;/a&gt;, and slightly tongue in cheek).

I trust in the teachings of the Buddha, because I have tested them, and they have worked as advertised up to this point. I do not trust God, because if he/she/it does exist as an anthropomorphic being, he/she/it certainly has not been there for me in any fashion that I can understand, comprehend and/or fathom.

Most of the teachings of Jesus fall under the same category as Buddhism. Many of his teachings were love and compassion based. I have problems with certain passages that are currently in the Bible. This leads me to my fascination with the history of that document, and who decided what was put into it. Be that as it may, are we to simply take the parts of his teachings that we agree with, and ignore the rest? Or just assume that one day, the hateful passages will make more sense?

I am certain that someone will point out that it seems that I do the same thing with Buddhism. However, at this point in space-time I can wrap my head around the metaphor of reincarnation more easily then I can being told that folks which do not agree with a certain religion will burn in Hell, metaphor or not. It's this dehumanization of disagreeing people that I really have a problem with.

If we can agree that everyone perceives everything differently then everyone else, it's just a small step to understanding that truth is based on perspective. When that leap is made, you simply have to allow others to believe as they wish, perhaps asking pointed questions about what and why and how. What they do with those questions is up to them. However, if they do not have good answers, perhaps they should start looking?]]></wp:comment_content>

Buddhism says that suffering is the lot of all creatures (everyone is in hell in a way) and that the only way out is non-existence.  I find both the preoccupation with suffering and the concept that not existing is better than existing to be extremely troubling.  At least Christianity has a heaven.]]></wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p><span class="caps">PORTLAND</span>, Oregon-A tiny chemical reactor that can convert vegetable oil directly into biodiesel could help farmers turn some of their crops into homegrown fuel to operate agricultural equipment instead of relying on costly imported oil.</p>
<p>"This is all about producing energy in such a way that it liberates people," said Goran Jovanovic, a chemical engineering professor at Oregon State University who developed the microreactor.</p></blockquote>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the misconceptions that I have heard about Buddhism is that Buddhists, being detached from the world, are uncaring or cold.</p>


	<p>This shows a great deal of misunderstanding about what reducing attachment actually means. We we talk about being attached to the world, or things in the world, we are talking about emotional and mental ties to these things. A perfect example is folks who get violent or emotional because their team lost a game. It's only a game. Even if you had bet all your money on the game, it's only money, that you lost because of a <strong>game</strong>. With out attachment, we can enjoy the game, with out the negative side effects if "your" team looses.</p>


	<p>Does this mean that I cannot feel love for someone or something? No. I can be dispassionate and unconnected, and still feel compassion and love for some one or something. One of the things that I recall from a book that I read by the Dali Lama was "<em>When you look at some one, think, I Love You towards them. Even if you do not say it, your demeanor will show it, and they will respond</em>" (paraphrased). Letting go of attachment allows you to honestly and openly practice this.</p>


	<p>Releasing attachment actually allows a person to be more loving and compassionate.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>Buddhism says that suffering is the lot of all creatures (everyone is in hell in a way) and that the only way out is non-existence. I find both the preoccupation with suffering and the concept that not existing is better than existing to be extremely troubling.</blockquote>

	<p>Buddhism does indeed say that life is suffering. I don't see this 'preoccupation' as anything other then looking around and seeing that the world is in fact a suffering filled place. Realizing that suffering has been an essential part of life for all of recorded history is the first step towards learning how to live with out the addiction to suffering that we all, well, suffer from.</p>


	<p>If we are not aware that we are sick, how can we cure ourselves?</p>


	<p>Happiness is transient. So is suffering. Everything in this world is transient. Buddhism sees this, and gives us a path out of suffering. This path does not lead to non-existence, but rather to emptiness. There is a very large difference between non-existence and emptiness. It has taken me over 20 years of asking questions and searching to get to where I am now, and to the miniscule level of understanding that I have.</p>


<blockquote>"Emptiness:" this is one of the most subtle, elusive and widely misunderstood of all Buddhist ideas, sometimes summed up with the phrase "the unsubstantiality of all phenomena." Contrary to popular misconception, this is not a nihilistic philosophy, as it does not deny the very real existence of things <del>- it just asserts that things are not as they seem. The concept is that reality as we know it is illusory in many ways, and is actually empty of certain qualities we believe it to have, because our perceptions and conceptions are misleading. This is not to say that things don't really exist, but rather it is to say that they exist in a way that is vastly different to what our perceptions would lead us to believe. So in Buddhist thinking, our ordinary "reality" or "existence" is empty of certain qualities it appears to have. An example of a quality we mistakenly perceive in some things is permanence. Things are actually empty of permanence, because everything changes, and there are no exceptions to this. Even though a mountain might seem like a permanent feature of the planet, or even the universe, in fact the mountain, as well as everything else, is in a state of continuous flux and decay. It's just that we aren't aware of some of those changes which occur too slowly for us to notice. One of the most interesting examples of this principle of Impermanence is that the top of Mt Everest is made of the same stuff as the ocean floor -</del> limestone. That's because the top of Mt Everest once was the ocean floor! Due to the ongoing continental drift, the earth's crust is still buckling and pushing up the height of the Himalayas by a few centimeters each year. . . Other examples of apparent qualities that our existence is actually empty of are self-identity and inherent [ie, non-conditional] existence</blockquote>

	<p>-<a href="http://www.dharmathecat.com/buddhism.htm">Dharma the Cat</a></p>


	<p>Nirvana is pointed to as the ending to the Buddhist path.</p>


<blockquote>The fact is, Nirvana can only be explained to the 'unenlightened' by negation. The Buddhist texts tell us what it cannot be thought of as, but the only positive descriptions of it tend toward non-existence. An example of this is the simile of the fire that the Buddha uses in his dialogue with Vacchagotama. He asks whether the fire, when it is extinguished, can be said to have gone north, south, east, or west. Of course, the obvious answer is that the fire no longer exists. Nirvana, however, cannot be described as existing, not existing, both existing and not, or neither existing nor not. For Buddhism, even nothingness is constituted by the relative contingencies that arise co-dependently as samsara.</blockquote>

	<p>The fact of the matter is we, as unenlightened beings, can no more understand enlightenment then a earthworm can understand flight. Only by walking the path can we come to understand where it ends.</p>


	<p>This in no way means that we are blindly faithful to the path. It's more like stairs then a path. Each step up is hard work. Each step also lays out a definitive goal <em>for that step</em>. The Buddha instructs us to walk away from the stairs if at any time they fail us.</p>


<blockquote>This truth is as equally attainable by the disciples as it was by the Teacher, and their knowledge is independent of him. The Buddha once asked Shariputra, "Do you believe what I have been explaining to you?" Shariputra answered, "Yes, I see that it is so." The Buddha asked him, "Are you saying this just out of faith in me?" Shariputra answered, "No, I answered in agreement not because of faith in the Blessed One, but because I clearly see for myself that it is so." [Pubbakotthaka Sutta, Saim. S.V. 220]</blockquote>

	<p>-<a href="http://www.buddhistinformation.com/role_of_faith_in_science_and_bud.htm">Bhikkhu P.A. Payutto</a></p>


	<p>We are at all times to question, think and examine what we believe and what we hold to be a truth. We are all walkers on these steps - our only difference is where we are on them, and what path we have taken up them.</p>


<blockquote> At least Christianity has a heaven.</blockquote>

	<p>Which seems more reasonable? An eternal life sitting on clouds and singing which cannot be proven to exist, or learning how to be happier here and now?</p>]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I would expect that heaven would be at least as hard to explain as nirvana.  Given that you best effort seems like mostly gibberish to me, and having respect for both your faith and your intelligence, I would certainly not even attempt to explain heaven.

However, even a layman should be aware that the concept of heaven would be perfect happiness.  I would imagine that for some people, the best they could approach in attempting to describe it would be singing on clouds.  For a serf during the dark ages, that would probably seem pretty darn wonderful.

Your version of Buhdism seems similar to me to that of Christians who don't believe in Christ as a son of God or the resurrection, merely that he was a good teacher and a powerful philosopher.  There is nothing wrong with this per se, but a person holding that belief isn't really, from what I know of theology a Christian.  Your discomfort with reincarnation and karma seem similar to me.

What it boils down to, is pretty basic philosophy with similar concepts held by a wide range of peoples.  For the most part, I find it either trivial or meaningless.  There is suffering, there is no permance.  Nothing there seems to me to be that profound or unique.

I guess, I don't find suffering all the horrible in the scheme of things.  I certainly would not choose to eliminate it if I could.  In the wise words of Captain Kirk: &quot;You know that pain and guilt can't be taken away with a wave of a magic wand. They're the things we carry with us, the things that make us who we are. If we lose them, we lose ourselves. I don't want my pain taken away! I need my pain!&quot;]]></wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>Are you a Christian who doesn't feel represented by the religious right? I know the feeling. When the discourse about faith is dominated by political fundamentalists and social conservatives, many others begin to feel as if their religion has been taken away from them.

	<p>The number of Christians misrepresented by the Christian right is many. There are evangelical Protestants who believe strongly that Christianity should not get too close to the corrupting allure of government power. There are lay Catholics who, while personally devout, are socially liberal on issues like contraception, gay rights, women's equality and a multi-faith society. There are very orthodox believers who nonetheless respect the freedom and conscience of others as part of their core understanding of what being a Christian is. They have no problem living next to an atheist or a gay couple or a single mother or people whose views on the meaning of life are utterly alien to them-and respecting their neighbors' choices. That doesn't threaten their faith. Sometimes the contrast helps them understand their own faith better.</blockquote></p>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I don't find his arguments very convincing at all.  Basically, he is asserting that his values are true 'Christian values' and others are not.  Yet he doesn't do this by arguing on the merits, he simply argues that religious values cannot inform social policy.  Breaking this down further, one would have to assume that no values, religious or otherwise, should inform social policy and that a pure libertarist philosophy is the only valid one.

While I myself have many libertarian instincts, they are a result of certain values that I hold, not the concept that values themselves are irrellevant.

While Sen. Santorum has been criticised for his man-on-dog statements, I don't think his logic is faulty there.  If we take the position that no personal values can inform social policy, then we are, automatically, in a place where we can't say anything is 'wrong' or should be disallowed.

Rather than try and make blanket statements that values shouldn't inform social policy, we should grapple with each issue on the merits and explore the competing values that conflict on these issues.

The anti-slavery efforts prior to the civil war were driven largely by Christian groups.  Were they also 'Christianist'?]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I agree with Dave...Um...The other dave... Yeah... Obidave :)

I think that he talks to rejecting 'fundamentalism' in all it's guises, in all faiths and/or lack thereof.

Social Policy should be made with the best for all possible people in mind. When you allow fundamentalism to steer policy, or any non-inclusive ideology, you are causing great harm.

I would say that folks who try and enforce their narrow view of morals are the problem, be they Christian, Muslim or Hare Krishna. I also feel that certain philosophies are more prone to this kind of abuse then others. So, I advocate tolerance, questioning and keeping the brain engaged.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I doubt I disagree with either of you too much on the best choice for various issues, I just disagree with this sort of analysis as being useful.

'best for all possible people' is subjective.  So is 'narrow view of morals.'

I certainly advocate tolerance, questioning and keeping the brain engaged but not out of a notion that I shouldn't try and force my values on anyone, but rather that these are values, and they are superior values in and of themselves.

That is a very different arguement than saying, in essence, that a persons values are not legitmate if they are informed by religious faith.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I wholeheartedly agree with &quot;Net Neutrality&quot; on premise....  But as with all issues before Congress, especially in today's special-interest political environment, the motivations and methodology are now as important as the issue itself.  My company talking points are &quot;this is a solution without a problem.&quot;  I don't always personally agree with my company line, but this time, I do.  This is government interference without demonstrated market failure, and that is often a losing proposition for the government.  I appreciate your comments in the other post about this issue....  I don't disagree.  I'm one of the biggest fans of the First Amendment you can find.  I consider the internet to be a public commodity like radio frequencies, and that it belongs to the public.

One other thought, though.  If ISPs decided to operate the way the proponents of net neutrality suggest, they'd hemorrhage customers.  It's silly to think that this idea hasn't crossed the minds of ISPs before and been discounted for that same reason.  If they wanted to censor the internet, they'd be trying it already.  If for no other reason, it doesn't make business sense....]]></wp:comment_content>

The problem that I see is that if an ISP does do this, how are the non-internet savvy customers going to know? The FCC does not allow folks to jam TV or radio stations.

I would prefer a free market solution to this issue, and I agree that it very well might be to early to act on this, however I think that it's a very good idea to start educating the public about this important issue.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I am a little bit agnostic on net neutrality but leaning against it.  The 'solution in search of a problem' argument carries quite a bit of weight with me, and the more drastic scenarios that will happen if this is not enacted seem quite unlikely.

It also occurs to me that a changing profile of net use will make changes in how things have always been necessary.  The price of internet usage is based largely on how an average user uses the internet.  Adding VOIP and movies on demand will change that greatly.  Right now, those who make extensive use of this sort of thing are partially getting a free ride because most people dont.  As this changes and more people adopt extensive use models things will get more expensive.  The question then is, does everyone pay the increased cost or do only the users of those services pay the increased cost?  Net neutrality seems to be everyone pays those costs.

As for the FCC and radio, the justification there is that everyone owns the airwaves, so a government regulating body is appropriate to determine how it is used.  That obviously doesn't apply to wired networks.

Also, as a caution the FCC exists to portition this bandwidth.  They have moved beyond that purpose though and do regulate content.  See Howard Stern or Janet Jacksons nipples.  The Government ends up having a lot more interest in regulating content than a private company does, and there is little chance of switching services if that happens.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[It's no more a piggyback service then, say, Google or Ebay. All of these services send their packets over the public internet. None of them have invested very much in wire. They pay other companies to - ISP's that provide &lt;b&gt;them&lt;/b&gt; with bandwidth.

What some the ISP's that are wanting to do is to be able to bill the customers for bandwidth, and then re-bill the content providers for access to that same bandwidth.

Basically, it's like extortion to the content providers. The ISP's say - if you want your packets to be able to cross into our space, you need to pay a fee.

While I think that it's perfectly fair for ISP's to pay interconnect fees to each other and to Mae East and Mae West, an ISP charging another ISP's customer again for the bandwidth that was already paid for via the content provider's fees and the ISP's interconnect fees is getting a little bit out there.

All I want to see is pay once and get what you pay for. ISP's blocking things like YouTube or Vonage because they are not the ISP's pet project is simply not a level playing field. If the ISP's want folks to use their VOIP service over, say, Vonage, then make theirs better. Don't cripple the competition because they will not reimburse you for your customers using the bandwidth that they have purchased from you to access their service rather then yours.

wow - sorry that was a wee bit longer then I had expected :)]]></wp:comment_content>

	<p>I have been watching this controversy for some time now and I have really mixed feelings about this. I can see the worth of having a database of who called who, but I find the implications to civil liberties to be chilling. I do believe that the Government has a responsibility to it's citizens to attempt to protect them, and their liberties as much as possible. I know that the line we have to walk is very very fine some times. However, I believe that if the government needs some additional powers, it needs to follow the established protocols to obtain those powers. Not simply grab them.</p>


	<p>I fully support the efforts of watch dog groups like the <span class="caps">EFF</span>. I think that the freedoms this country was founded upon are in part because of 'watchdog groups'. I also support using the tools that we have at hand to defend ourselves against folks who want to take all of our freedoms and lives away.</p>


	<p>The advent of the internet, and it's associated technologies, are going to totally change our culture.  They all ready have in fact. Just check out you tube or myspace!</p>


	<p>I hope that the citizens have a say in how this brave new world is formed...</p>]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Personally, I don't like the NSA's relationship with commercial businesses like ChoicePoint, but what can you do? *shoulder shrug*

It is hard for the citizens to have any say when they don't really know what &quot;information&quot; is being collected. Keeping databases is one thing, but sooner or later you're going to look at other &quot;interesting&quot; variables. I can't imagine that they only look for &quot;international calls&quot; and discard all the rest of the information. It might not have a use for the war on terror, but is has a use...

No one throws out data. That's just not smart.  Large pools of data like the NSA phone record database are a gold mine.]]></wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Size some times really does matter.</p>


	<p>One of the things that I pass the time with is <a href="http://www.farfuture.net">Traveller</a>, especially <a href="http://www.sjgames.com/traveller/">G:Traveller</a>, and the new <a href="http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/traveller/interstellarwars/">G:Traveller Interstellar Wars</a>. 'Hard' Science fiction has always been a favorite read for me, and Traveller brought it to the gaming table. I think that I got my first Traveller book in '82. It's been a non-stop obsession ever since. I own a copy of the basic rules of every iteration of the game - Classic Traveller, Mega Traveller, Traveller: The New Era, Traveller 4, Gurps Traveller and Gurps Traveller 4th edition.</p>


	<p>So, I guess that you could call me a traveller geek!</p>


	<p>One of the basic technologies of Traveller is the Jump Drive. It allows you to leave 'normal space' at point A and emerge at point B in about a week. Depending on the ship, point B could be as much as 6 parsecs (18 light years) away. There are a few caveats, however. The most important is that you do not want to start or end your jump with in 100 diameters of a massive object. For some reason, stellar objects have been ignored in this calculation.</p>


	<p>Enter my quick and dirty Stellar Data Tables! (v2:<a title="Stellar_Data.xls" href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=pkLVSHTh_WPyeYXks6jc8cA&#38;hl=en">Stellar Data</a>)</p>]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I think you failed to be geeky enough (or perhaps you were way to geeky)

The 100 diameters thing doesn't really make a lot of sense from a scientific point of view.  What would really matter is how much gravity distortion there is at what distance.  100 diameters is probably a good rule of thumb for terrestrial type worlds (which is mostly what Traveller is concerned with) but would be way off for objects of different densities.

The sun is about 1/4 as dense as the earth, so using 100 solar diameters doesn't make a lot of sense.  It is unlikely that given these considerations a solar body would ever have much effect on a jumping ship, few destinations would be that close to a star.  That is probably why they have been ignored.  Similar adjustments should probably be made for gas giants.

I can't believe I bothered to reply to a post this geeky.  That says really bad things about me.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The solar system and galaxy are not contiguous massive objects. What we do know about Jump Space is that entering Jump from within 100 diameters of an object more massive then the object entering jump causes problems.

A few years ago there was a huge brouhaha about 'jump masking'. It seems that some one interpreted Jump limits to mean that a ship in jumpspace would be precipitated into normal space when it's vector in realspace intersected the 100 diameter limit of a massive object. This threw jump as we know it on it's ear. See, if the target for a jump was on a path through the star of either system, you would have massive problems.

Well, Traveller Cannon was consulted, Marc Miller and Loren Wiseman voiced their (powerful) opinions, and as I recall, jump masking was tossed out of the OTU (official traveller universe).

Some feared that IW brought it back, but that is not the case. The jumpspace physics are simply not as well understood in the 2100's (IW's time period) as in the 51st century (traveller's main time line). Go figure.

In the 2100's, in order to make a jump, the equations need to have a massive object at the end. You cannot jump into deep space, unless you know where there is a brown dwarf or rouge planet to 'anchor' your jump. This had a massive impact on history. There is a brown dwarf between Sol and Bernard's Star. As Bernard's Star is about 2 parsecs away, and we only had Jump-1 (one parsec at a time) we needed a 'staging point'. So, the Star Leaper One was used to ferry fuel between Sol and the Brown Dwarf Jump Point, building up a reserve for the Star Leaper Two, which jumped onwards to Bernard's Star, and found the Vilani Empire, thousands of years old, technically advanced, stagnate, and populated with Humans.

I do not postulate jump masking at all - I see the trip through jumpspace as an arc of sorts. At the start and end, you are closer to realspace, and therefore interact with massive objects. The objects cast 'shadows' into jumpspace based on their realspace size, not blocking but making entry and exit much more difficult if with in the 100 diameter limit. it's not a question of mass, but rather a question of past a certain mass per cubic centimeter, that shadow is cast. Jumpspace is one of the few ways that Traveller breaks rules, so I allow it a certain amount of 'spooky action at a distance'. In the rules, it is stated that you can initiate jump from a planet's surface, it's just not advised!]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Of course nothing is a 'continguous massive object' as everything is more 'nothing' than it is 'something'

The big problem I see with using the steller diameters without considering density, is it makes planetary diameters pretty much irrellevant for most earth-type worlds.  The 100 diameter number for the earth doesn't matter much if you need to be 2 AUs away from the sun anyway.  I would imagine that the vast majority of habitable planets would have the same problem.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Well, the sun is about 1.5 g/cm3 and the earth is about 5.5 g/gm3.  All iron-nickel planets seem to be somewhere in this neighborhood with Earth being a little on the heavy side.

Here is a page that gives some generalizations: http://www-astronomy.mps.ohio-state.edu/~pogge/Ast162/Unit2/structure.html

Larger/brighter stars are less dense.

I would guess that if you take this into account, the jump shadow of a star is irrellevant for the vast majority of destinations.  Habitable worlds would always be outside of the jump shadow.  Only weird destinations (mining colonies, perhaps a military installation purposefully placed deep in a jump shadow) would be effected by this.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hey Tskyo-

I've got concerns about this position on the Net Neutrality, mostly because I actually work in government affairs in this industry.  I think it's relevant to point out the cable industry on this issue in addition to that of other companies: http://www.ncta.com/ContentView.aspx?hidenavlink=true&amp;amp;type=lpubtp10&amp;amp;contentId=2934  It should be noted that this bill is backed by a NUMBER of special-interest groups who have an interest in regulating cable companies.

Companies like Google, Yahoo, Microsoft and Amazon are some of the most successful companies in the world.  Network neutrality regulations could lock in their dominant positions and make it even harder for new companies to challenge them.  These companies are flourishing in large part because of the billions cable and other companies invested in building a broadband infrastructure.

That's just one of the talking points, but a good thing to consider nonetheless.

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I agree; there are two sides to this. However, the basic way that I view it is, I pay my ISP for bandwidth. Where I want to go with that bandwidth should be my choice. If my ISP starts to block certain sites who do not pay them for the privilege of working on my computer, or even just slow them down, that is going to greatly annoy me.

As far as competition goes - I really do not know if that is a valid argument or not. If you look at the history of internet businesses - it's been all about the upstart with a better idea getting ahead. Look at Google. Who'da thunk that a search engine company like Google could have taken on Yahoo and the Microsoft head to head? If their traffic had been relegated to a slower connection, and their site had been slower, would they have had a chance? Will small startups like Reddit, Writely, Digg or Ubuntu Linux be able compete with established companies who can afford to pay for the 'high speed' connection?

I guess that it comes down to this question: Do we want a two or three tiered internet, where content providers who pay a premium to all of the ISP's out there get preferential treatment, or do we want a level playing field?

Network infrastructure upgrades are very expensive. The interconnects between the tier-1 providers are complex and expensive facilities. More expensive then they really need to be - but that is another story :). I personally believe that it's the responsibility of the consumers to pay for bandwidth. If a company is undercharging for it's services to get a larger market share, who's fault is that? Back in the day, it was a truism in the industry that an ISP that charged less then $30 for a dial up line was cutting their own throat. As hardware costs dropped, that number dropped. The ISP's that undersold that mark, and were able to survive did quite well for themselves. I think that we are in that phase of the Broadband market. Folks will start using less expensive technologies, the cost per unit of speed will drop, and this will all blow over.

And then, the unit of speed will increase again, and we will go through all of this yet again.

I really have faith in the technical abilities of our geeks. We have developed new methods for things like streaming video which have cut the bandwidth requirements for them significantly. Better compression, P2P, distributed computing and downloading, all of these technologies will impact the hunger for bandwidth. Utilizing mass market technologies rather then high priced proprietary solutions for infrastructure seem to be the way to go to me.

For example, I was involved in a project where a certain vendor for the infrastructure was required by management fiat. The cost for each site with the preferred vendor's hardware was $9,000. We brought up another vendor who had similar quality and just as good support. Our choice would have cost $1,000 a site. The preferred vendor was the one chosen, of course. This preferred vendor is the preferred vendor for most shops out there. Sort of like IBM was in the 80's - way over priced, but 'no one ever got fired for buying Big Blue'.]]></wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[In a comment on Lord Chimmy's <a href="http://bloodsuckingfiends.blogspot.com/2006/06/bitches.html">post</a> about Ann Coulter's new book, we are directed to <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views06/0610-23.htm">this article</a>.
<blockquote>Now that its original meaning has been hopelessly distorted by hatred and bad vibes, the term "Christian" really should be banished to the hall of linguistic abominations where it belongs.

	<p>Say "Christian" in mixed company and the image of a bejeweled evangelist hawking a right-wing social agenda will come immediately to mind.</p>


	<p>Very few think of Christians as the same folks who embraced lepers and other social outcasts even before faith-based tax credits kicked in to provide "incentives" for doing the Lord's work.</blockquote>
Tony Norman really hits the nail on it's head. He does an excellent job of summing up what I have been trying to say:</p>


	<p>Christianity, as it is practiced today, is not a positive influence on the world. I really feel that today's version of Christianity is not all in sync with what Jesus taught. We will really never know, as we do not have any good accounts of his life, other then the massively edited and contradictory Bible.</p>


	<p>Some who call themselves Christians are very good and helping people, however, more are self absorbed and only really in it for the <em>afterlife insurance</em> policy that it gives. I was actually told "Well, since you do not believe in an afterlife, what's to stop you from being a Christian just in case they are right?" Am I missing something? Does God really want followers who follow for the sake of following?</p>


	<p>I propose the following: Re-write the Bible. Get rid of as many of the problems as you can. Extract the essence of Christianity, and repackage it for a new century. Don't say 'if it's not broke don't fix it' because it is broken. Look at the perception that is out there. "<em>Say "Christian" in mixed company and the image of a bejeweled evangelist hawking a right-wing social agenda will come immediately to mind.</em>" pretty much sums it up.</p>


	<p>Now, don't get me wrong. I am certainly not espousing moving the 'Christian Agenda' away from the Right. I simply want folks to understand what Christian means. And it's not forcing your version of family values down my throat through laws aimed at removing my choice. You could make a law that stated "everyone in this great nation was mandated to attend Church and profess the Christian Faith". Would that make us all Christian? I don't think so.</p>


	<p>That would simply take the rest of the meaning out of the word. We think it's barbaric when a person is executed in a Muslim country for infractions such as dressing wrong, but in attempting to make every action that does not agree with Christian morality illegal, we are fast slipping down the slope towards just such a barbaric legal system.</p>


	<p>I heard an Evangelical talking on some talk show. They said that they would use every means at their disposal to enforce their views - because if you disagreed with them, it was analogues to drinking drano, and of course we would try and stop someone from drinking drano. Yes, if I were to see some one drinking drano, I would attempt to stop them. I would do this because I have empirical evidence that drinking drano can kill or seriously harm you. No one has evidence that if you are not Christian, you are in physical or spiritual danger. We have beliefs about it, but beliefs do not proof make.</p>


	<p>I guess that I can sum it up as: Be damn sure before you force another person to act or not act in a certain way. There is nothing black and white in faith based religions. Faith, by definition, is not provable. When it comes to effecting others, make sure that you are on the side that is provably good."<em>an it harm none, do as thou wilt</em>"</p>]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[So basically what you are saying, is that if a moral code isn't popular it must be wrong and needs to be changed, while at the same time asserting that that same moral code is so popular that we are fast slipping down the slope to a thoecracy.  Obviously something is wrong with that premise.

I think it absolutely improper for someone who is not part of a belief system to dictate to those who are how they need to reform their system.  Telling Christians to rewrite their Bible is hubristic in the extreme.  Further, telling them to rewrite their Bible because what they are doing doesn't match what Christ taught (apparently something you have divined from the Bible) is nonsensical.

It is certainly appropriate to debate where, when and how moral values that people hold should be leashed to the power of government.  The idea that value systems should be imposed on others is the fault here, and it is certainly not confined to the Christian Right.

Socialists want to redistribute wealth based upon their value systems.  Feminists want to redefine male/female power roles and alter the structure of our language based upon their value systems.  Libertarianish Buhdists want to make sure Government stays out of what they regard as their personal business based upon their value systems.

None of those value systems is 'provable.'  The Wiccan Rede you cite can't be 'proven' any more than any other.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;So basically what you are saying, is that if a moral code isn't popular it must be wrong and needs to be changed, while at the same time asserting that that same moral code is so popular that we are fast slipping down the slope to a thoecracy.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

No... what I am saying that that the way Christianity is practiced &lt;b&gt;today&lt;/b&gt; by a large majority of those who proclaim them selves as Christian does not have a positive influence on the world at large. I do not speak to popularity at all.

What I take issue with, as always, is some people's view that it is OK to use their moral compass to make choices for others, when those choices do not harm anyone. Take for example, Gay Rights. It does not harm me if two people want to get married. It does not harm me if two Christians want to get married. Why does it harm me if two Gays want to get married?

I totally agree that there has to be some moral underpinning to the law - and I believe that should be &quot;if you do not harm anyone, do what you want&quot;, not &quot;This musty old book says so, so I'm gonna make you do it!&quot;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;I think it absolutely improper for someone who is not part of a belief system to dictate to those who are how they need to reform their system. Telling Christians to rewrite their Bible is hubristic in the extreme. Further, telling them to rewrite their Bible because what they are doing doesn't match what Christ taught (apparently something you have divined from the Bible) is nonsensical.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I never told anyone &lt;b&gt;to&lt;/b&gt; do anything. I proposed what I saw as a solution to a problem that I perceive. I do not expect anyone to take action on it. I'm sorry, but I were to see some one drinking drano... Get the idea? It's perfectly acceptable for a Christian to dictate how a some one else lives and what they believe, but, hoo boy. Just try and even question the smallest part of Christianity.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Socialists want to redistribute wealth based upon their value systems. Feminists want to redefine male/female power roles and alter the structure of our language based upon their value systems. Libertarianish Buhdists want to make sure Government stays out of what they regard as their personal business based upon their value systems.

None of those value systems is 'provable.' The Wiccan Rede you cite can't be 'proven' any more than any other.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I simply want to free people to make up their own minds. If they want to use english in a way that fits with their values system, they have every right. If they want to give their money to socialist programs, again, they have every right. Where I draw the line is when they try and give my money to socialist programs, or force me to speak english in a way that I do not agree to. For example, why should my money (taxes) be used to fund an art project in New Jersey? If I want to fund that project, I should be given the choice to fund it myself.

&lt;blockquote&gt;What if, in addition to filing a tax return every year, we had the chance to decide where our tax dollars would be used? Programs and government departments that no one likes would simply go away.

I would take that one step further. What if we did not even have to pay taxes? What if we simply supported the programs that we used and that we liked directly, through user fees and direct contributions? It's all about freeing us from the oppression of the majority and of the minority. What makes you happy and comfortable does not necessarily work for every other American out there.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I just get tired of Tsyko's broad brush generalizations of, &quot;Christianity, as it is practiced today, is not a positive influence on the world.&quot;  By golly, there are a lot of them thar' Christians, and a lot of them thar' religious differences and personal differences as well.

Is this the same Tsykoduk who (a few years ago) ostensibly professed an Episcopalian faith and got married at St. John's Cathedral??

I, too, get upset at cable TV's version of Christianity, but I try to remember that religion/faith is practiced by people who happen to be human, and therefore fallible.  Some do try to force their views down other's throats, but some do still embrace the lepers.  Let's remember the latter when we talk about &quot;The Lord's Work.&quot;]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Can we try and get past the drive by commenting, Obi? Do you have a point to make other then I am wrong?

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;b&gt;Some do try to force their views down other's throats&lt;/b&gt;, but some do still embrace the lepers. Let's remember the latter when we talk about 'The Lord's Work.â€&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And, &lt;i&gt;let's do something about the former&lt;/i&gt;.

That's all that I have been saying.

There are a lot of Christians, some good and some bad, but the public and vocal majority seem to be of the bad kind.

Just to set the record straight, I did not profess any faith at Saint John's. Would it make you happier if I had? What would it prove or disprove if I had?

I did my time in Church. I saw all of the plastic people who showed up, professed their faith, and then sped home, angry with the other drivers because they were keeping them from watching their football game. I would say that no more then 10% of the Christians that I have ever met were 'real' Christians. And that is my problem in a nutshell. People leveraging religion for personal and group gain. People who think that it's more important to force their views on everyone else around then allowing others to make up their own minds. People &lt;b&gt;at Saint Johns&lt;/b&gt; who would rather verbally attack their priest then consider small changes to their liturgy.

If Christianity has such a grasp on truth and righteousness, why do some Christians seem to need laws to back them up? If these truths are universal, why are they not self-evident? If God exists, why would not civilization simply want to be 'god-fearing'?

What I see, as an outside observer, is some Christians feeling like they are loosing their grip on the hearts and minds of this country. They seem to feel that we are not a Christian country anymore. We are a cosmopolitan society now - a society of immigrants. If you get down to it, the Christians moved over here, and made war on the folks who lived here first, because they were not Christian. Who said that the 'heathens' needed saving anyways?

Christianity's history is full of examples of grievous abuses of power and disregard for human life. I am sure that the gentle reader can name just about as many atrocities committed in the name of God and Christ as I can.

I ask why?

People are imperfect. This is true. However, some of the teachings that are passed down in the Bible can be used to rationalize some pretty bizarre and inhuman behavior. Putting those kind of 'truths' into imperfect people's hands is a recipe for disaster. Am I wrong for trying to point these out?]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;If Christianity has such a grasp on truth and righteousness, why do some Christians seem to need laws to back them up?&lt;/blockquote&gt;Some people are busy bodies.  Christians are not (and almost all do not claim to be) perfect.  Not all busybodies are Christians though and not all Christians are busy bodies.  It seems to me that you dislike busy bodies, but choose to attack Christians.  That is a misplaced target.
&lt;blockquote&gt;If these truths are universal, why are they not self-evident?&lt;/blockquote&gt;Why would a universal truth necessarily be self-evident?
&lt;blockquote&gt;If God exists, why would not civilization simply want to be 'god-fearing'?&lt;/blockquote&gt;Perhaps God allows people to choose good or evil, and some choose evil.&lt;blockquote&gt;What I see, as an outside observer, is some Christians feeling like they are loosing their grip on the hearts and minds of this country.&lt;/blockquote&gt;What I see, is Christians feeling that our society is destroying itself.  They want to prevent that from happening.  They may be wrong about that, but if so it seems best to convince them on the issues, rather than assume that their motive is simply to have power.  A few might fall into that category, but not the majority.&lt;blockquote&gt;Who said that the 'heathens' needed saving anyways?&lt;/blockquote&gt;Christ and his apostles.&lt;blockquote&gt;Christianity's history is full of examples of grievous abuses of power and disregard for human life.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Humanities history is full of examples of this.  Christianity is no worse than others and better than some.  &lt;blockquote&gt;Am I wrong for trying to point these out?&lt;/blockquote&gt;That isn't what you have done.  You haven't said X part of Christianity is wrong what you have said is that Christianity is wrong.

From your previous comment: &lt;blockquote&gt;What if we did not even have to pay taxes? What if we simply supported the programs that we used and that we liked directly, through user fees and direct contributions? It's all about freeing us from the oppression of the majority and of the minority. What makes you happy and comfortable does not necessarily work for every other American out there.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Ever heard of the tragedy of the commons and the free-rider program.  That is why this is not just a bad idea, but a very bad idea.  This is the extreme edge of libertarianism that tends to be as fanatical as anything in Christendom.  I find it at least as disturbing.]]></wp:comment_content>

I really do not dislike anyone. There are some who\'s actions I disapprove of, but I do not dislike them because of those actions. Luckily, I live in a democratic society where I can voice that disapproval (as well as vote), and try and explain what I believe to be a better way. I will (and have) voiced disapproval with many actions by many people over a variety of subjects. To claim that I \'&lt;em&gt;attack Christians&lt;/em&gt;\' but \'&lt;em&gt;dislike busy bodies&lt;/em&gt;\' is not understanding what I am saying, or only reading about half of the things that I talk about here.
&lt;blockquote&gt;What I see, is Christians feeling that our society is destroying itself. They want to prevent that from happening. They may be wrong about that, but if so it seems best to convince them on the issues, rather than assume that their motive is simply to have power. A few might fall into that category, but not the majority&lt;/blockquote&gt;
And, they that is attempted (convincing them on the issues), the person attempting it is often castigated as a heretic, or simply dismissed as a loony. I might be a wee bit strange, but I don\'t think that I am quite at the loony stage yet :).

From my perspective, Christianity (&lt;em&gt;as it is practiced today by a portion of Christians&lt;/em&gt;) &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; wrong on several accounts. I have never met anyone who could sufficiently rationalize some of the more inhumane directives in the Bible. About the closest that anyone has come is the theory that Christ was not just a spiritualist, but also a revolutionary, concerned with the mistreatment of the Jews by the Romans at the time. The theory goes on to state that the revolutionary parts of Christ\'s message were included by the authors of the Bible.

Thus the few vitriolic passages that some folks are confused by, and that enable the borderline cases to justify their acts of violence (be it physical, mental or verbal). One of my favorite scenes on the news to illustrate this was when a sign toting Christian anti-abortion activist kicked a young mother in the stomach as she was entering a Planned Parenthood clinic, causing a miscarriage. It\'s actions like this, coupled with the whole \'warfare\' and \'us vs them\' and \'if you are not on our side, you are the enemy\' themes in the Bible that I have an issue with. That theme is divisive. It\'s true that the Bible also says to love your enemies, but which theme are we going to follow today? The Bible\'s message is at best scattered, and at worst down right confusing.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[&quot;Christianity, as it is practiced today, is not a positive influence on the world.&quot;  Point: this statement is an overgeneralization and is offensive to those of us who feel that Christianity can be a very positive influence on the world.  How some people individualy practice it can be reprehensible, and therefore wrong in-and-of itself.

&quot;We will really never know, as we do not have any good accounts of his life, other then (sic) the massively edited and contradictory Bible.&quot;  point: Contradictory is debatable.  Again, I recommend &quot;Evidence That Demands a Verdict&quot; by Josh McDowell.

&quot;Some who call themselves Christians are very good and helping people, however, more are self absorbed and only really in it for the afterlife insurance policy that it gives. I was actually told 'Well, since you do not believe in an afterlife, what's to stop you from being a Christian just in case they are right?â€ Am I missing something? Does God really want followers who follow for the sake of following?&quot;  Point: I agree with your notion that faith and religion practiced out of fear and ignorance is worthless.  I believe God does not want followers of this nature.  Robotic religion is no substitute for genuine faith...Jesus called-out the Pharisees for such things!

&quot;I propose the following: Re-write the Bible.&quot;  Point: Wow.  Um, bad idea.  There are so many translations out there these days I think it would be hard not to find one that suits your tastes.  The greatest problem with re-writing Scripture is that in the year 2006 we are so far removed from the original witnesses/writers that your problems of &quot;getting it right&quot; are enormous.  It would be like trying to re-write a newspaper article from the NY Times from the 1800's.  A re-write isn't any kind of fix, and, in fact, would just further serve to muddy the waters.

&quot;Get rid of as many of the problems as you can. Extract the essence of Christianity, and repackage it for a new century.&quot;  Point: The essence of the message has never changed, just some of the personal presentation.  And who is to say what the &quot;problems&quot; are?  There will never be consensus, but that doesn't mean we throw out the baby with the bath water.

I agree with much of the rest of what you said.  Forced belief is no belief at all and drives us towards a Nazi Germany approach to goverment (this, of course, is BAD).  My gut reaction to your post was simply that so many people judge Jesus by his followers, and this has NEVER been a good thing to do.  People are people, and mistakes are made.  It is up to each of us to judge the book by its cover.  Broad, sweeping statements of &quot;Christians are this-and-such&quot; and &quot;The Bible is this-and-such&quot; are just as unfair and improper as &quot;Buddhists are this-and-such&quot; and &quot;Muslims are this-and-such.&quot;

Your perception is your reality, but it doesn't mean it is how things really are.  I agree: TV does a good job of embarrassing me sometimes about my faith because I know that many people judge it (and me) based on charlatans in leisure suits and gold rings.  It turns my stomach.

All that being said, I know I cannot change the world, I can only change myself.  I can work towards a better tomorrow for me and my kids (hence, my career) but I understand that I am just a tiny little cog in the giant system and to get stressed out about the tings I cannot change...that way lies madness.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;I really do not dislike anyone. There are some who\'s actions I disapprove of, but I do not dislike them because of those actions.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Let me rephrase, you dislike people getting into your business.  For some reason, you have apparently decided that this is part and parcel of Christianity.  That is not my experience with Christians.  I find myself more effected by busy bodies from other realms (the draconian anti-smoking laws here for instance.)  Leaving that asside, I think my point was fairly clear.  &lt;blockquote&gt;And, they that is attempted (convincing them on the issues), the person attempting it is often castigated as a heretic, or simply dismissed as a loony. I might be a wee bit strange, but I don\'t think that I am quite at the loony stage yet :) .&lt;/blockquote&gt;Leaving asside the question of your sanity, that certainly seems a twoway street.  You have often dismissed faith as being foolish, perhaps borderline insane.  Some Christians always behave the way you describe, but it is my guess that they way you choose to present your ideas makes many people intractable who could be reasonable.

I am not sure which passage of the Bible you are refering to.  To the best of my knowledge abortion is not specifically mentioned in the Bible, although there are passages that lead one to believe that a fetus is a person and therefore abortion is murder.  Others who are not Christian, or not Religious at all share that belief.  One would expect (and hope for in fact) rather strong denounciations of murder in our society.  Certainly though I don't know of any mainstream group, even the more virulent ones on TV that espouse violence against women seeking an abortion.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[All of you make some good points, or at the very least you certainly have a passion for argument.

Who needs a rewrite of the Bible when you can just pick a flavor of Christianity (i.e., Eastern Christianity, Catholicism, or Protestantism) that suits your belief system? With so many denominations there's something for everybody...

Anyway, I don't have a problem with anyone's religion, but I do get a little tired with the religious politicking. Ann Coulter is a poor example of a Christian if you ask me (as am I). She uses her vitriolic words simply to rile up liberals which leads to increased book sales among conservatives. She's a sideshow, and she's playing a tune that she knows will make her money. She's clever like a fox...and a real dislikable bitch (IMO).

Politics and religion are like acid and water...when you mix them things are going to heat up. I think that especially after the 2004 election there is an even bigger rift [than normal] between Christians and &quot;the rest of us.&quot; No one likes to have a finger waved in their face, and that's what I've always hated about religion: The smugness. The unwillingness to see those who are not like you as good. The attitude that the rest of us are heathens.

It is a dirty business, and I normally avoid it...until I am called out personally. Everyone is a little bit right and a lot wrong if you ask me. Insisting that your belief system is the only way to go is never going to go over well with the unconverted.

Sorry to ramble...I usually do this on my own blog :)]]></wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.thebanmappingproject.com/">The Theban Mapping Project</a> has some really cool maps and 3d walk throughs of the tombs in Thebes and the Valley of the Kings.</p>


<blockquote>Since its inception in 1978, the Theban Mapping Project (TMP, now based at the American University in Cairo) has been working to prepare a comprehensive archaeological database of Thebes. With its thousands of tombs and temples, Thebes is one of the world's most important archaeological zones. Sadly, however, it has not fared well over the years. Treasure-hunters and curio-seekers plundered it in the past; pollution, rising ground water, and mass-tourism threaten it in the present. Even early archaeologists destroyed valuable information in their search for museum-quality pieces.</blockquote>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>Net neutrality is this:

<code>If I pay to connect to the Net with a certain quality of service, and you pay to connect with that or greater quality of service, then we can communicate at that level.</code>

	<p>That's all. Its up to the ISPs to make sure they interoperate so that that happens.
Net Neutrality is <span class="caps">NOT</span> asking for the internet for free.</p>


	<p>Net Neutrality is <span class="caps">NOT</span> saying that one shouldn't pay more money for high quality of service. We always have, and we always will</blockquote></p>

<title>Does the Dali Lama get Pedicures?</title>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Would the Buddha enjoy manicures?<p></p>These thoughts crossed my mind as I was relaxing on fathers day. My son and my wife got me a Pedicure that morning. I must say, it was a very relaxing experience.<p></p>Physical pleasure seems to be engraved into our very core. There are evolutionary reasons, things that help us survive as a individual and as a species tend to feel good, whist things that might impact our survival chances for the worse seem to feel bad. So, physical pleasure keeps us on a path that is perhaps best for the species and ourselves.<p></p>I recall a story that I read once, where they had taken soldiers and "re-wired" them so that physical pain felt good to them. The problem was that they tended to get themselves killed by ignoring wounds and just pressing on. Good suicide troops, but not what you would want for the regular military.<p></p>So, we can assume that our pleasure/pain responses are there for a reason.  And, it has served us pretty well in the past.<p></p>However, perhaps it's time to start to take a look at these responses, and make conscious choices about them. Do I want to engage in this pleasure? Do I have the capacity to deal with this pain? What will the outcome of all of this be? It can be a very Zen like moment when you realize that you can look in the future, and make a choice about this experience. You can decide if it's in your and your communities best interest to do this. You have to reflect on your actions, motives and beliefs.<p></p>Life is reflective. Your actions reflect back on you. All of life is reflective in this manner. Your outlook, your demeanor will reflect back on you. How you perceive the world is how the world becomes. If you take the time to reflect on your actions a pattern will emerge. If you are hateful, you will tend to get hate in return. If you are loving, you will tend to get love in return. You should question each act and belief. Assure yourself that it does not harbor any hate.<p></p>Questioning is a integral part of this thing we call life. You have to question yourself, your motives and your actions at every turn. Some seem to take questioning as an affront. Questioning simply is a tool for exploration. If your belief structure cannot stand up to a question, how strong is it?<p></p>If your belief cannot stand up to a pedicure, well, that's just another story.<p></p></p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, I am trying out some new software called '<a href='http://journler.phildow.net/'>Journler</a>'. It's - gasp - journaling software built for the Mac. It's look and feel is really nice, and it seamlessly integrates with Wordpress and several other blogging platforms. So, after two whole days of use, I have to give it two feathers up!<p></p>What ever that means.<br /></p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><center>Here he grieves
he grieves hereafter.
In both worlds
the wrong-doer grieves.
He grieves, he's afflicted,
seeing the corruption
of his deeds.

	<p>Here he rejoices
he rejoices hereafter.
In both worlds
the merit-maker rejoices.
He rejoices, is jubilant,
seeing the purity
of his deeds.</center></p>


	<p>-Dhammapada, 13-14, translated by Thanissaro Bhikkhu</blockquote></p>


	<p>Many people take issue with the Buddhist belief in reincarnation. I never really have. It makes logical sense to me. I do not expect it to make any kind of sense to anyone else, in the traditional understanding. It's pretty out there, right up there with <span class="caps">FSM</span>'s. That's OK. I really do not expect anyone else to understand.</p>


	<p>However, that does not mean that others cannot learn from this example. We can look at this concept from another angle. For example, we are reincarnated, each day, with each choice that we make. We can never go back to that person that we were yesterday, we can never know who we will be tomorrow.  It's a death of a thousand cuts if we make the wrong choices, but it can slowly lead to contentment and happiness if good choices are made.</p>


	<p>Take, for example, the common criminal. He often feels the social, spiritual, mental and physical ramifications of his deeds. This path that he is on is not a happy path, and yet he keeps choosing it. Why? Is is some karmic inertia? Some mental defect? Some social defect?</p>


	<p>I would suppose that it's the path of least resistance. It's easy to keep on doing the same thing, hoping for better results. It's hard to move away from those choices. It takes a lot of discipline and intestinal fortitude. The first step is to release all of the negativity that encumbers you. When you even think negative thoughts, for a fleeting moment, that effects your outlook, and ultimately the outcome. It's a classic case of <a href="http://changingminds.org/explanations/theories/self-fulfilling_prophecy.htm">Self-Fulfilling Prophecy</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>Martin Eberhard holds the brake down with his left foot and presses on the accelerator with his right. The motor revs, the car strains against the brake. I hear ... almost nothing. Just a quiet whine like the sound of a jet preparing for takeoff 5 miles away. We're belted into a shimmering black sports car on a quiet, tree-lined street in San Carlos, California, 23 miles south of San Francisco. It has taken Eberhard three years to get this prototype ready for mass production, but with the backing of PayPal cofounder Elon Musk, Google's Larry Page and Sergey Brin, and ex-eBay chief Jeff Skoll, he has created Silicon Valley's first real auto company.</blockquote>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, in my quest to find the perfect combination of blogging software and learning a new language, I have decided to migrate this site - again - to yet another platform.</p>

<p>This migration was not as clean as the last few - no fault of the software that I was or am running. It was totally my mess up, and I freely admit that.</p>

<p>Anyways, poke around and see what you think.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I started out on Blogger many moons ago - and then decided to self host with Wordpress. I really like Wordpress - I think that is one of the better blogging platforms out there.

I am starting to learn Ruby/Rails - so I decided to move my primary blogging platform over to it. No better way to learn the force yourself to use it, eh? :)

I tried Typo in the 2.6 era - and was not really impressed. There was not a good data migrator from Wordpress.

When Typo 3 hit, I decided to take the plunge. I was underwelmed with it's back end. It seemed to be really slow - due to a ton of AJAX calls. The front end performance was reasonable - however slower then Wordpress.

I saw Mephisto, and since I am a KISS aficionado, I really groked the underlying principles.

Plus - they have cool release names! :)]]></wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>Carbon dioxide levels are substantially higher now than at any time in the last 800,000 years, the latest study of ice drilled out of Antarctica confirms.</p>

<p>The in-depth analysis of air bubbles trapped in a 3.2km-long core of frozen snow shows current greenhouse gas concentrations are unprecedented.</p></blockquote>

<p>--<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/5314592.stm">BBC</a></p>

<p> It really seems to me that it's time to 'wake up' to climate change. We have evidence all around us that it is actually happening. Temperatures are on the rise, storms are getting more violent and the world is going to end. Was this caused by Humans? We don't know for sure, but the evidence points that way.</p>

<p> Does it really matter? No. We need to batten down the hatches, because we are coming out of a very peaceful time, according to the past climatological evidence. The estimated <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide#Concentrations_of_CO2_in_atmosphere">6500 million tonnes of carbon</a> that <b>we</b> put into the air per year cannot be helping. Just think about this: "<i>Volcanic releases are about 1% of the amount which is released by human activities</i>". And then we go and deforest large parts of the world. Trees eat CO<sub>2</sub></p>

<p> Another major concern is the speed of the change</p>

<blockquote><p>The "scary thing", he added, was the rate of change now occurring in CO2 concentrations. In the core, the fastest increase seen was of the order of 30 parts per million (ppm) by volume over a period of roughly 1,000 years.</p>

<p>"The last 30 ppm of increase has occurred in just 17 years. We really are in the situation where we don't have an analogue in our records," he said.</p></blockquote>.

1,000 years of CO<sub>2</sub> in 17 years. That cannot be a <i>good thing</i>.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>To be serious for a second: my thing about religion is generally not that it's bad, but that it's false. The history of religion is far too complex to be summed up as 'goodâ€ or 'bad,â€ and there are obviously components of both. The Salvation Army, odious discrimination policies notwithstanding, does a tremendous amount of good. Religious people are generally better at donating to charity than non-religious ones (last I heard; I don't have specific figures, so this could be wrong). And I like a lot of the art and architecture.</blockquote>

	<p>I think that most large movements (religious, political, economic) have good sides and bad sides.</p>


	<p>Look at Iraq. Saddam was an ruthless dictator who ruled with an iron fist, but the streets were safer. We are trying to give Iraq democracy and freedom, but the streets are less safe then a white guy in a white sheet with a pointy hat in Compton.</p>


	<p>I think that we need to look at all of our institutions, and remove the negative portions. They are simply not healthy for us, or for our children.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Yeah - the green zone is sure safer :)

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Saying we need to get rid of the bad stuff is pretty banal...While it is true, it is also useless.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At the very least, it starts a discourse. To simply ignore the bad parts, and accept the status quo is to doom us to repeating the same mistakes over and over.

I think that if we distill it down, we can agree on several 'bad things' that we should look at:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hurting Others physically&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hurting others emotionally&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Harming ourselves&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spreading Hate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

While some of these are very hard to attain, some are very simple. Simply decide not to use violence as a negotiation technique. Simply decide to not strap that bomb to your chest and blow up a Mosque.

When the simple things are hard, the hard things are nigh near impossible. We need to make the simple things simple again, and then work on the hard things.

We need to reject teachings of hate, no matter where the come from. Islam, Christianity, Paganism - all have their skeletons. Let's air them out, and see what we can build that is better.]]></wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>European scientists voiced shock as they showed pictures which showed Arctic ice cover had disappeared so much last month that a ship could sail unhindered from Europe's most northerly outpost to the North Pole itself.

	<p>The satellite images were acquired from August 23 to 25 by instruments aboard Envisat and <span class="caps">EOS</span> Aqua, two satellites operated by the European Space Agency (ESA)</blockquote></p>


	<p>-<a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/climatewarmingarctic">Yahoo! News</a> and <a href="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&#38;ned=us&#38;q=polar+ice+north&#38;btnG=Search+News">Others</a></p>


	<p>This is a troubling trend. I have a gut feeling that we are either on, or just past the tipping point. What is the tipping point? It's when we can no longer fix the damage that we have done..</p>


	<p>You see, there are several contributing factors here. The first is called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albedo">Albedo</a> of a planet. It is usually expressed in a percentage (0 - 100%). Basically, it's the percentage of light that is reflected back from a solar body. The big issue here is that ice is very reflective. When the polar Ice caps start to loose large areas, the earths albedo gets lower, we absorb more energy from the sun, and we heat up. This causes more ice to melt, and the albedo lowers again...</p>


	<p>The other issue is there are green house gases trapped in the ice around the world. So, we have the ice melting, albedo lowering, more green house gases are released, and the global temperature goes up even faster.</p>


	<p>Now, I do not think that humans are the sole cause of this, however, we have sure accelerated the changes. We are dumping so much carbon into the air that we simply cannot not be effecting the natural cycles.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>Less than three weeks after Hurricane Katrina, a study published in Science showed that, while the number of tropical cyclones had not increased between 1970 and 2004, their strength had surged: Category-4 or -5 hurricanes where more than 50 percent more frequent in the second half of that period than in the first (Webster et al., Science, 16 September 2005).</blockquote>

	<p>-<a href="http://www.aip.org/pnu/2006/split/793-1.html?source=rsspnu">American Institute of Physics</a></p>


	<p>Hmm... I wonder why this would be happening? Perhaps we should look around for other trends during the same time slice?</p>


<blockquote>Elsner used an elaborate statistical method (first devised by economics Nobel Prize winner Clive Granger) to answer the first of those two questions. He examined spikes in global atmospheric temperature (using satellite and ground-based data collected by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) and compared them to seasonal changes in average sea-surface temperatures for the entire northern-hemisphere part of the Atlantic (based on National Atmospheric and Oceanic Administration data). His analysis showed that the spikes in atmospheric temperature mostly tended to come right before hurricane-season spikes in oceanic temperature, suggesting that the first were causing the second.</blockquote>

	<p>-Again, the <a href="http://www.aip.org/pnu/2006/split/793-1.html?source=rsspnu"><span class="caps">AIP</span></a></p>


	<p>The earth is a huge series of interconnected systems. (and you thought I was going to say pipes). The Average person dumps around 24 pounds of carbon a day into the air (world average, the average American dumps 122 pounds per day into the air). The earth can absorb about 9 pounds of carbon per person per day. That means, the carbon levels are increasing by about 13 pounds per person per day. Or about 65 billion pounds per day. That much change to one of the earth's systems will have an effect on the others.</p>


	<p>We know several things here.</p>


<ol>
<li>The carbon levels are the highest that they have been in 800,000 years (as far back as we can see).</li>
<li>The carbon change has been unprecedentedly fast</li>
<li>We are pumping billions of tons of carbon into the air per year</li>
<li>Carbon absorbs heat.</li>
<li>Carbon in the air changes the Albedo of a planet</li>
</ol>

	<p>I know that there are some who do not feel that global warming is true - or even possible. However, science is often simply applied common sense. It makes sense, given the evidence, that we have had an effect on the global climate. It's time to wake up to that fact, and stop playing Chicken Little.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I abhor any use of torture to gain information. By stooping to these base tactics, we are no better then those who we fight. America is supposedly a beacon of freedom in this dark world. Are we to become simply another thinly veiled totalitarian regime?</p>


	<p>We are at a turning point in our history as a nation and as a world. Do we want to be friends with the world, or at war with the world. If we do aspire to rule the world, is it through military might or inclusive partnerships?</p>


	<p>I cannot stress enough how strongly I am against us modifying the Geneva Convention for this 'war on terror'. Terror is not an army which we can meet on the battlefield and vanquish. It's a group of thuggish criminals who operate outside of the rules to gain an upper hand.</p>


	<p>Treat them like the criminals they are, arrest them, jail them, but treat them fairly. As you would want to be treated were the circumstances reversed.</p>


	<p>I urge you to <a href="http://action.downsizedc.org/wyc.php?cid=56">send a letter</a> to your congresscritter in regards to this issue.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Well - that is true. Then let's treat them with due process, the same as any other criminal.

There should not be a 'special' class of not-quite-soldier, but not-criminal.

The language that I have heard from the current bill grants them some of the rights of the Geneva Convention, but withholds others.

I guess that there are two issues here...

1) We should not re-write the Geneva Convention at our whim.

2) We should decide if we give terrorist groups the status of 'army' and 'state actors' and treat them like POW's or treat them like criminals.

Honestly, I do not really mind either tactic - as long as they get due process.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I think that terrorist groups are inbetween being soldiers and criminals.  They have political goals and consider themselves 'at war' with us, but they act in ways outside of the laws of war, and are not 'state actors.'  The Geneva convention of course is an agreement between states on how to handle conflict between states (with a bit on how to handle intra-state conflicts.)

There is nothing in it on how to handle conflicts that range internationally in which one of the sides is not a state actor.

Of course the Geneva Convention is also a proxy for how states will behave in general, what it is moral for states to do.

Because the Geneva Convention doesn't apply to terrorists, we are not 'rewriting' it.  What we are doing is explicitly spelling out what we consider the moral proxy of the Geneva convention to be and how it applies to not-state international soldiers (unlawful combatants.)

Here is an example.  Lets say we captured a Yemani man in Afghanistan who has financially supported Al-Qaida and is acting as a message courier for that organization.

We could treat him strictly as a POW.  That would mean he would be held (without tiral) until the end of hostilities (decades?), and then released unless it could be shown that he personally committed acts that go against the laws of war.  Probably not in this case.

We could treat him as a criminal.  Since he didn't do anything on American soil, and didn't do anything that would fall under the jurisdiction of the ICC (even if we were a part of it) we would have to let him go.

We could give him to the Yemeni Government, where he would either be tortured or released (depending on how the Yemeni Gov. felt that day as far as I can tell)

Theoretically, we could give him to the Afghanis, but they lack the resources and, presuming this activity was before the formation of the current Afghani Government he may not have broken any laws.

It seems blindingly obvious to me that their is a hole in how we deal with such things.  Indeed, the existence of that hole is probably a large reason that such groups have become so prevelent, state sponsorship of terror counts, in part, on this 'hole' existiing.

It is certainly fair to argue that the particular means of filling this hole isn't the right one, but if you argue that the hole doesn't exist at all, I don't think you really have anything useful to say in the discussion.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Subsection 4(b) (26) of section 950v. of HR 6166 - Crimes triable by military commissions - includes the following definition:

&quot;Any person subject to this chapter who, in breach of an allegiance or duty to the United States, knowingly and intentionally aids an enemy of the United States, or one of the co-belligerents of the enemy, shall be punished as a military commission under this chapter may direct.&quot;

It seems that the bill is going beyond just the Geneva Convention. I think it is just likely to be used against citizens of the United States as it is terrorists from foreign countries. In the previous subsection it opens with &lt;i&gt;Any person subject to this chapter who, in breach of an allegiance or duty to the United States&lt;/i&gt;...which basically means a citizen of the U.S. (as only U.S. citizens owe an allegience to the States).

Yale Law professor Bruce Ackerman wrote in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-ackerman28sep28,0,619852.story?coll=la-opinion-rightrail&quot;&gt;L.A. Times&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;i&gt;The compromise legislation, which is racing toward the White House, authorizes the president to seize American citizens as enemy combatants, even if they have never left the United States. And once thrown into military prison, they cannot expect a trial by their peers or any other of the normal protections of the Bill of Rights.&lt;/i&gt;

A law on the books doesn't necessarily have to be applied in the manner for which it was intended. While terrorist acts are deplorable and abhorrent I don't think we need to sidestep the Geneva Convention to gain the upper hand.

I think this is a bad piece of legislation. It does smack of totalitarianism. To allow evidence gained by torture to be heard before a military tribunal is beyond the scope of what democratic governments should do [whether in a time of war or peace].

Look at what we're deciding here...Torture. A bill on torture. No where in this bill does it say anything specific about how it is to be used. It doesn't say only muslim extremist will be tortured. This bill could just as easily be used against U.S. citizens. However, regardless of what the bill is meant for...you don't advocate torture. If the U.S. is a true democracy then they'll find a way to win the war on terror without becomming animals ourselves.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I'll be the first to say that 'illegal combatant' status applied to an American Citizen has troubling implications.  I have heard the allegations that the bill allows for that, and also that it does not.  Frankly, I don't know.

That is something I will watch for, and if it happens it is something that needs to be addressed.  I expect that if American citizens apply to this, it will be declared unconstitutional.

Of course it is factually innaccurate to say that the bill allows for torture.  What is does, is specify that some things some people say should be torture are not torture.  So far, I haven't heard the outspoken opponents of this grapple with any of the specific things noted and explain why they are so horrible.

The provisions do violate the Geneva conventions, if the full protections given to POWs are considered applicable to these unlawful combatants.  As I mentioned above though, I think that their is a reason for a difference between the two types of things.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I think that the uncertain language that promotes 'allegations' both ways is very troubling. Since we live in a 'ignorance of the law is no excuse' state, laws should be constructed so that they are very concise, to the point and easily readable.

I have read HR 6166, and I am not sure if it will pertain to Americans as 'illegal combatants' - one place it states one thing, and another it redacts that and states another thing.

As to why 'they are so horrible' - I am sorry, but we are supposed to be a beacon of light in a dark world. We are supposed to be the white hats in a grey world. We carry ourselves as if we had a moral advantage.

If we set up legal methods and procedures for using these methods, this effectively codifies  legal use of these methods. At that time, what happens to our moral advantage? What differentiates us from the bad guys?]]></wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So - it seems that there is some scientific evidence starting to mount that Mediatation can improve your physical health.</p>


<blockquote>The vagus nerve controls the production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), a protein that signals the body to mount an inflammatory response. Decreasing vagus nerve activity ups <span class="caps">TNF</span> synthesis, whereas increasing vagus nerve activity limits <span class="caps">TNF</span> production and therefore inflammation.

	<p>Though inflammation can be useful in fighting infection, excessive inflammation can cause disease, such as Crohn's disease or rheumatoid arthritis.</p>


	<p>Tracey's research opened the door to treating inflammatory diseases with drugs or devices that control vagus nerve activity, an approach that has proven successful in animals.</p>


	<p>But at the conference, Tracey raised the possibility that vagus nerve activity, and therefore inflammation, could also be controlled mentally.</p>


	<p>Meditation has been shown to slow heart rate via signals that travel down the vagus nerve. Those same signals, Tracey speculates, may also dampen immune response, making it possible for people to ease the symptoms of inflammatory diseases through exercises such as meditation and yoga.</blockquote></p>


	<p>-<a href="http://www.seedmagazine.com/news/2006/09/an_om_a_day_could_keep_inflamm.php">Seed Magazine</a></p>


	<p>We know that Mediation seems to have profound effects on the mind, spirit and body. Mediation can lead to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditation">trance</a> state - which is what hypnotists use to effect changes on their subjects.</p>


	<p>We have also seen the incredible 'mind over body' that intense concentration can give - granting folks the ability to overcome great amounts of pain or discomfort. How do we explain these feats?</p>


	<p>I think that this is the first step towards the West recognizing that the Eastern Mystical traditions might be based on some physical evidence.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.ubuntu.com">Ubuntu Linux</a> is getting ready to release a new version - <a href="https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/edgy">Edgy Eft</a>. You can check out a list of goals for Edgy <a href="https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/edgy">here</a>, as well as see the progress being made on them.</p>


	<p>I have installed the beta on three desktop machines now, and I must say, I am really impressed. For a beta, the fit and polish is really nice. It's darn close to what a Linux machine needs as a Windows replacement. It's snappy, even on my old P-3 machine - it positively flies on my <span class="caps">P4 HT</span> machine.</p>


	<p>Is it to the point where I would replace <span class="caps">OS X</span> with it? I don't think so. I don't mind using a proprietary OS or programs - if they get the job done. If there is a F/OSS program that does as good of a job, or better, then of course I will use it. <span class="caps">OS X</span> is unix based, stable, fast, and elegant. It does the job for me, and quite well, at this point.</p>


	<p>The old thing that I would like to see is better integration between <a href="http://avahi.org/">Avahi</a> (the <a href="http://www.multicastdns.org/">mDNS</a> stack) and <a href="http://netatalk.sourceforge.net/">netatalk</a> (the implementation of <span class="caps">AFS</span> for Linux).</p>


	<p>I have not really spent much time hacking on that particular issue yet - so check back for updates.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So - a while back I talked about getting <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/EdgyEft">Edgy Eft</a> installed and spun up on my home Server. One of the issues that I had was getting my <a href="http://www.apple.com">Macs</a> to play nice with this new version. I used to use <a href="http://www.porchdogsoft.com/products/howl/GettingStarted.html">Howl</a> to provide my <a href="http://www.multicastdns.org/">mDNS</a> goodness. Well, Howl is no longer supported - or even developed. So, it was time to get with the, errr, times.</p>


	<p><a href="http://avahi.org/">Avahi</a> is the new kid on the block. I was hoping that it would automagically pick up all of the services that I had running on my box, and publish information about them. Well, that was not the case. I have heard rumors that <a href="http://netatalk.sourceforge.net/">netatalk</a> (the Linux implementation of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Filing_Protocol"><span class="caps">AFP</span></a> - Apple's file sharing protocol. <span class="caps">OSX</span> also supports <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Message_Block"><span class="caps">SMB</span></a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_File_System"><span class="caps">NFS</span></a> and others, but <span class="caps">AFP</span> is native, fast, and easy.) would automagically register with Avahi, but that did not work.</p>


	<p>So, I have been putting off getting it configured, and relying on <span class="caps">SCP</span>/SFTP to access my server shares. As <span class="caps">OS X</span> does not support writing to <span class="caps">FTP</span>/SFTP out of the box, I have had to use a third part tool (<a href="http://rsug.itd.umich.edu/software/fugu/">Fugu</a> - I cannot recommend this program highly enough) to accomplish this. Last night, I had some time, and hacked on Avahi until it worked.</p>


	<p>The Edgy install of Avahi pretty much worked out of the box. However, it did not configure any services. I had to dig through several man pages to get the following <a href="https://greg.nokes.name/assets/2006/10/5/afpd.service">format</a> figured out:</p>


<table class="CodeRay"><tr>
  <td class="line_numbers" title="click to toggle" onclick="with (this.firstChild.style) { display = (display == '') ? 'none' : '' }"><pre>1<tt>
</tt>2<tt>
</tt>3<tt>
</tt>4<tt>
</tt><strong>5</strong><tt>
</tt>6<tt>
</tt>7<tt>
</tt>8<tt>
</tt>9<tt>
</tt></pre></td>
  <td class="code"><pre ondblclick="with (this.style) { overflow = (overflow == 'auto' || overflow == '') ? 'visible' : 'auto' }"><span class="pp">&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; standalone='no'?&gt;</span><span class="c">&lt;!--*-nxml-*--&gt;</span><tt>
</tt><span class="pp">&lt;!DOCTYPE service-group SYSTEM &quot;avahi-service.dtd&quot;&gt;</span> <tt>
</tt><span class="ta">&lt;service-group&gt;</span><tt>
</tt>  <span class="ta">&lt;name</span> <span class="an">replace-wildcards</span>=<span class="s"><span class="dl">&quot;</span><span class="k">yes</span><span class="dl">&quot;</span></span><span class="ta">&gt;</span>%h<span class="ta">&lt;/name&gt;</span><tt>
</tt>  <span class="ta">&lt;service&gt;</span><tt>
</tt>    <span class="ta">&lt;type&gt;</span>_afpovertcp._tcp<span class="ta">&lt;/type&gt;</span><tt>
</tt>    <span class="ta">&lt;port&gt;</span>548<span class="ta">&lt;/port&gt;</span><tt>
</tt>  <span class="ta">&lt;/service&gt;</span><tt>
</tt><span class="ta">&lt;/service-group&gt;</span></pre></td>
</tr></table>


	<p>This goes into /etc/avahi/services - or where ever you have your Avahi services directory. It's pretty easy once you get the format down. I made services for <a href="https://greg.nokes.name/assets/2006/10/5/sshd.service">ssh</a> and <a href="https://greg.nokes.name/assets/2006/10/5/httpd.service">http</a> as well.</p>


	<p><i>Update: Just did basic setups for <a href="https://greg.nokes.name/assets/2006/10/6/svn.service">svn</a>, <a href="https://greg.nokes.name/assets/2006/10/6/rsync.service">rsync</a>, <a href="https://greg.nokes.name/assets/2006/10/6/ntp.service">ntp</a> and <a href="https://greg.nokes.name/assets/2006/10/6/ipp.service">ipp</a></i></p>


	<p>I would like to see the Avahi folks include a directory called 'services-disabled' or some such thing, and have the common service definition files in there already. All you would have to do is symlink the files over to the services directory when you needed them enabled - you could have the daemon startup scripts automagically look for and do this when they start.</p>


	<p>Then, you would have Linux with the plug and play simplicity of a Mac.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>All new threats entail huge uncertainties. Then, as now, there was a pronounced tendency to assume the worst, and for the government to claim enormous discretion in protecting the American public. The Bush administration has consistently argued that it needs to be protected from Congressional oversight and media scrutiny. An example is the National Security Agency's warrantless surveillance of telephone traffic into and out of the United States. Rather than going to Congress and trying to negotiate changes to the law that regulates such activities, the administration simply grabbed that authority for itself, saying, in effect, 'Trust us: if you knew what we know about the threat, you'd be perfectly happy to have us do what we're doing.â€ In other areas, like the holding of prisoners in GuantÃ¡namo and interrogation methods used there and in the Middle East, one can only quote Moynihan on an earlier era: 'As fears of Communist conspiracies and German subversion mounted, it was the U.S. government's conduct that approached the illegal.â€

	<p>Even if we do not at this juncture know the full scope of the threat we face from jihadist terrorism, it is certainly large enough to justify many changes in the way we conduct our lives, both at home and abroad. But the American government does have a track record in dealing with similar problems in the past, one suggesting that all American institutions â€” Congress, the courts, the news media â€” need to do their jobs in scrutinizing official behavior, and not take the easy way out of deferring to the executive. Past experience also suggests that the government would do far better to make public what it knows, as well as the limits of that knowledge, if we are to arrive at a balanced view of the challenges we face today.</blockquote></p>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I will certainly agree that Congress has been quite lax in the whole thing, doing too little, too late.  And I will agree that the Bush administration has relied on that, and even perhaps encouraged it.

It particular, I think that the detainee laws, which were recently passed should have been done in 2002, not 2006.

That is one reason I don't worry so much about a democratic takeover of Congress.  Divided government is its own check on this sort of thing.

I don't necessarily agree with the characterization that the American Government has a poor track record in dealing with this, or at least that it has a poor track record in comparison with anything other than a platonic ideal of perfection.  While certainly nothing has been perfect, and certainly people suffered who didn't deserve to, on the whole our institutions have done quite well, avoiding excesses that other nations haven't and recovering quite quickly from mistakes.

I am absolutely sure that we have, and will, make a variety of mistakes in the war on terror.  Things will be handled poorly.  An assumption though that our government  will go totally off the rails at the slightest provocation isn't really warrented however, and I think it just as likely that worse things will happen if we are too skeptical and fight too hard against needed changes than if we are too complacent and trust too much.

Balance is key, and part of that balance is understanding that every change doesn't mean the sky is falling.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[We have made mistakes in the past - and what I took from this is not that the sky is falling, but rather that we (as the people of this great nation) need to do our part of the job. We need to question, and make sure that the actions of our government meet our individual moral compasses. When those actions do not, we need to bring that out in the light and examine it.

That is one of the big differences between 'us' and 'them'. We, at this moment, are free to disagree with, question, and generally oversee our government. The &lt;b&gt;moment&lt;/b&gt; that we start down the path of totalitarianism, the people should rise up and demand to change course.

Some feel that we are started down that path right now. I do not know if I agree with them or not, but there have been some troubling changes to the laws , as well as some power grabs that I don't think that I agree with. It bears much reflection and discussion...]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I don't see a whole lot of people saying, 'hey, this change might be a bad idea it could set a bad precident or cause some trouble, or perhaps it is not as just as we would like.'  What I mostly see is people saying 'Bush has ended civil liberties as we know them!'

(I am not necessarily talking about you here)

Part of the problem is probably that extreme, excitable voices that are obviously not grounded in reality are drowning out sober discussion on these issus.  The exitable loud voices make it really hard to see any real problems that might exist.

I will say that I am not sure what you mean by the 'moment' we start down the path to totalitarianism exactle.  I have always held that liberty and security are somewhat of a balancing act and promoting either at the cost of the other is a mistake.  As circumstances change, the balance changes as well.

As an example that is not WOT terror related, I would generally hold that it is a persons right to get, or not get medical treatment.  They should have a lot of liberty in that regard.  However, vaccines for comunicable diseases, especially highly contagious and life threatening ones can present a security challange, and in some case the Government, ordering mass vaccinations and reducing individual liberty in that regard is the right balance.

Some would say that this is starting down the path to totalitarianism.

So I would say that rather than worrying about the 'moment' we start down the path, we should pay attention to the area on the path where the no u-turn signs appear.  Free Speech and the Right to Keep and Bear Arms are big ones for me in that regard.  There might be others we should pay attention to as well.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;I would generally hold that it is a persons right to get, or not get medical treatment. They should have a lot of liberty in that regard. However, vaccines for comunicable diseases, especially highly contagious and life threatening ones can present a security challange, and in some case the Government, ordering mass vaccinations and reducing individual liberty in that regard is the right balance.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And what about the .01% of people that have toxic reactions to those vaccines? And - if most everyone &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; vaccinated, only the unvaccinated with get the disease, and it was their choice to not get the vaccine..

Would you support a government ban on Windows, because the lax security impacts internet performance? (you know, botnets, worms, etc..)

How about a mandated government ban on alcohol consumption and smoking? Each are very bad for your heath - and smoking can effect others, after all.

I agree that security is a laudable goal, however we need to ascertain who we are securing ageist (ourselves? outsiders?).

It is a balancing act. However, I think that you and I have different views of where the balance point is... I tend to favor the individual, and I think that you are in favor of more security?]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[If .02% will die without a mandatory vaccination program and .01% will die with it, then I am good with the mandatory one.  It is also not true that only unvaccinated people will get the disease, some times vaccinations fail, and an unvaccinated person may become a carrier, infecting mass others.

Actually, I think I am fairly strongly in favor of the individual.  I oppose mandatory helmet laws.  I am in favor of ending the government monopoly on education.

Those are things I am opposed to on the merits, because I think they harm individual freedom without giving much, if any, benefit to public security.  I expect that I would chose the more libertarian position in 9 out of 10 issues.  I'm even for drug legalization.

However, I don't view liberty as the only good end.  Liberty for me is primarily a means to other good ends, including security.  In most cases, I think we are more secure if we have more liberty.

What I don't have any patience for is the proposition that liberty must always and at all times trump anything else.  I also dislike the notion that everything is a slipperly slope, and if we take one step wrong we are DOOMED to FACISM.  That is patently false, and our historical record shows that we can navigate back and forth quite well.  One aspect of this belief is the all-or-nothing view of politics that so frequently poisons political discourse and justifies any means to an end.

I expect that even on security issues you and I would agree almost all the time on the correct course.  The difference would be in how we structured our arguements, not what we actually agreed on.  I would look at what will be most effective and necessary while you would look at if it harmed liberty or not.

One reason though that I am in favor of 'more security' (or as I prefer to think of it, sufficient security) is that without a secure environment liberty absolutely cannot and will not prosper.  I don't believe in the anarchist utopia, it is not something that will ever happen.  Trying to put it in place, will result in totalitarianism like all the other utopian schemes.]]></wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the concerns that has been conveyed to me about Buddhism by many people - is that it's teaching of 'non-attachment' is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihilism">nihilistic</a>. I have struggled with explained how a teaching of non-attachment is, not only not nihilistic, but is all about being engaged in the world. Albeit from a different perspective.</p>


<blockquote>The image of an extinguished fire carried no connotations of annihilation for the early Buddhists. Rather, the aspects of fire that to them had significance for the mind-fire analogy are these: Fire, when burning, is in a state of agitation, dependence, attachment, and entrapmentâ€”both clinging and being stuck to its sustenance. Extinguished, it becomes calm, independent, indeterminate, and unattached: It lets go of its sustenance and is released.</blockquote>

	<p>So, by extinguishing our 'inner flame' of emotion driven responses to everything, we gain a dispassionate view, where we can attempt to chart the best course based on long term outcomes, rather then knee-jerk responses.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>
The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichstag_fire">Reichstag fire</a> was an important event in the
establishment of the Nazi Party as the rulers of Germany in 1933. On the night of 27 February (yes, a Monday), the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichstag_%28building%29">Reichstag</a> - the building in which the German
Parliament assembled - caught fire and was partially destroyed by a subsequent explosion.
<p>
Hitler had been sworn in as Chancellor of Germany less than a month earlier. Parliamentary president and Nazi Party official
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_G%C3%B6ring">Hermann G&ouml;ring</a> quickly declared the fire the work of
communist insurgents. Hitler then declared a state of emergency and persuaded the aging German President
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_von_Hindenburg">Paul von Hindenburg</a> to sign the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichstag_Fire_Decree">Reichstag Fire Decree</a>, which suspended the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weimar_constitution">Weimar Constitution</a>, thus nullifying many of the basic
civic liberties previously guaranteed to German citizens on the grounds that the state needed to act against communism
and needed the powers to search, detain, ban, disperse, and censor anything they deemed subversive.
<p>
In hindsight, von Hindenburg's assent wasn't the greatest political move ever made.
<p>
As to the fire itself, known communist Marinus van der Lubbe was tried, found guilty, and executed by the Nazis after he
confessed to starting the fire. It later emerged that van der Lubbe had been tortured to confession. Later in 1933, a retrial
held by the pre-Nazi German Imperial Court found the (now dead) van der Lubbe and the Communist Party leaders to be innocent.
This infuriated Hitler, who established his own court, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volksgerichtshof">Volksgerichtshof</a>,
at which treason and other capital offences were to be tried. The Volksgerichtshof became famous for the huge number of death sentences
it handed down.
<p>
Further investigation into the Reichstag fire further muddied the waters, with serious suspicions (including a sworn affidavit by Nazi
general Franz Halder at the Nuremburg Trials) that G&ouml;ring himself had started the fire. Historians argue variously that communists
really did start the fire and that the Nazis simply seized a golden opportunity to tighten their grip on Germany, while others conclude
that the Nazis masterminded the entire plot themselves and framed the communists.</p></blockquote>

	<p>-<a href="http://www.irregularwebcomic.net/1155.html">David Morgan-Mar</a></p>


	<p>Any resemblance to current events is simply coincidental.</p>


	<p>I <strong>do not</strong> believe that Bush is a Hitler wanna-be. I simply use this to point out - when the citizens stop watching, this is what can happen.</p>


	<p>Let me reemphasize this.</p>


	<p><strong>I am not drawing a correlation between any current U.S. government official, elected or otherwise and Hitler. I am not even saying that we are heading down this path</strong>. I am simply stating that a strong, active, and knowledgeable populace is what we need to stave off this kind of event.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote> "Not 24 hours after the release of <span class="caps">IE7</span>, Secunia reports Internet Explorer Arbitrary Content Disclosure Vulnerability. So much for the "you wanted it easier and more secure" slogan found on Microsoft's IE Website."</blockquote>

	<p>-<a href="http://secunia.com/Internet_Explorer_Arbitrary_Content_Disclosure_Vulnerability_Test/">Secunda</a> via <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/10/19/1326247&#38;from=rss">Slashdot</a>.</p>


	<p>Sorry - not even gonna  touch this one.</p>


<center><img src="https://greg.nokes.name/assets/2006/10/20/ie7.png" width="300px" /></center>

	<p><i>update:</i></p>


	<p>Christopher Budd has this to say on the <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/msrc/archive/2006/10/19/information-on-reports-of-ie-7-vulnerability.aspx">Microsoft Security Center Response Blog</a>:</p>


<blockquote>We've gotten some questions here today about public reports claiming there's a new vulnerability in Internet Explorer 7.  This is an issue that we have under investigation and so we have some technical information we can share about the issue.

	<p>These reports are technically inaccurate: the issue concerned in these reports is not in Internet Explorer 7 (or any other version) at all. Rather, it is in a different Windows component, specifically a component in Outlook Express. While these reports use Internet Explorer as a vector the vulnerability itself is in Outlook Express.</blockquote></p>


	<p>Hmm... that's like saying "You did not get food poisoning from the Hamburger you ate, you got it from the contaminants <strong>in</strong> the hamburger. Ok, so it's a problem in Outlook Express. However, IE is the target and attack vector. So, it's a problem with IE. Trying to pass the buck to another program is simply corporate misdirection. Time to own up, Microsoft!</p>


<blockquote>While we are aware that the issue has been publicly disclosed, we're not aware of it being used in any attacks against customers.

	<p>We do have this under investigation and are monitoring the situation closely and we'll take appropriate action to protect our customers once we've completed the investigation.</blockquote></p>


	<p>How about simply taking the novel approach of - say - releasing a patch? If it is in fact a problem with Outlook Express, and not IE - then sever that link between the two programs and call it good.</p>


	<p>And, since it has not been used to attack customers yet - why wait? According to Secunia, this exact same issue has been present in <a href="http://secunia.com/advisories/19738/"><span class="caps">IE6</span></a> for 6 months now. How long do your customers dangle, Microsoft?</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote> I believe that there is no God. I'm beyond atheism. Atheism is not believing in God. Not believing in God is easy-you can't prove a negative, so there's no work to do...</blockquote>

	<p>-Penn Jillette on <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5015557">This I Believe</a></p>


	<p>I believe that there is an elephant in Penn's trunk.</p>


	<p>I heard this spot when it was on, and I must say that I was moved. It concisely sums up a lot of the problems that I have with the entire concept of there being an 'omni-whatever' being. This is a topic that I have done a lot of writing about, and a lot of thinking about, and Penn can sum up my years of pondering in a few short paragraphs.</p>


	<p>When I first stumbled across the Buddhist teaching about God, I felt like I had come home. It felt right, and correct, and that it was summing up what I had been trying to verbalize all of these years. To sum it up - If God exists, and is all powerful, then he is evil to allow all of the suffering that has occurred at the hand of Man and Nature over the years. Evil to have turned a blind eye to what his creation has wrought.</p>


	<p>The idea that we need to ask forgiveness for our 'sins' from some higher power always struck me as wrong. What about the Hitlers of the world? What if they, after inflicting suffering upon their fellow man, saw the error of their ways, and recanted just before they died? Would they get treated the same as a Dali Lama or a Mother Theresa? According to the majority of the modern Christian movement - yes. Once you are 'washed in the blood of Christ' all your sins are forgiven. All.</p>


	<p>I believe that we are each totally responsible for our actions, and that we cannot seek forgiveness because there is no one to give it, others then the folks we have wronged. I believe that everyone else in the world believing this would make the world a better place.</p>


	<p>In my belief, there is no place for people who commit atrocious acts in the name of some religion, expecting to be forgiven. There is no forgiveness, Only consequences.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Of course not, the Dalia Lama is a pagan and Mother Theresa a papist so they will both go to hell! :)

Joking asside, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_evil&quot;&gt;the Problem of Evil&lt;/a&gt; is hardly breaking new philosophical ground.

I find the Buhdist interpretation rather simplistic myself, and hardly convincing but your mileage may vary.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Yeah, yeah.

That is actually another problem. Unless you take certain steps, even if you are very good, you will be punished for not taking those steps.

I agree that it's not breaking new ground, but I have never been given a rebuttal that actually worked. I am sorry, but &quot;&lt;i&gt;we are small, God is big&lt;/i&gt;&quot; does not really work for me.

If God exists, and God is some anamorphic creature that resembles us in though process, then we should be able to understand God's reasons for doing things.

If God exists, and is not anamorphic, and we cannot understand God's reasons, then the Bible is flawed, as there is no way that a limited human could write down Gods thoughts in a way that another limited human could understand. Also the Bible is flawed because it states that God made us in his image. Unless we look like God, we must assume that the Bible means mental image.

So, if God is not anamorphic, however, God created us in God's mental image, However, we cannot understand God's thoughts we are left with a logical fallacy.

Therefore, given the Bible's accuracy, God must be anamorphic.

Which means that God is driven by the same sort of thoughts and feelings that we are. Which means that he - through his inaction, has caused a lot of suffering.

If God exists, and the Bible is True, then we are stuck. Unless we bring FM in to the equation. To which I will reply: Flying Spaghetti Monster.

Some one who has done a much better job of it is interviewed by Colbert &lt;a href=&quot;http://richarddawkins.net/video/dawkins_colbert_chapters.mov&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. It's worth a watch. :)]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Well, this is probably far to complex a thing to debate in blog comments, rather large books have been written on the subject.

In brief though, the most compelling answer for me is that we do think 'like God' (created in his image etc.) but we certainly don't know everything that God knows, and certainly we are not capable of fully understanding God now.

I don't believe that the Bible, or any religious work, could fully explain the mind of an infinite being.  I also don't think that the Bible, or any religious work that I have encountered, makes the claim that it does so.  So in that sense, you are correct in that such works are 'flawed.'  I do think though that something can be 'true' and still be flawed.  In point of fact, I hold that the theory of evolution is 'true' and that it is also flawed.

Essentially, the premises you present above are wrong in their basic assumptions.

My best gues as to the answer to the problem of evil, is that while 'evil' is of course evil, allowing evil to exist is good.   That seems incomprensible to some people, but seems fairly self evident to me.

If there is no evil, then there can be no free will, things just happen as they were ordained.  Anything without will cannot be evil, and without evil their can be no free will.

I can make some guesses as to why free will is so important, but at the I think it boils down to enjoyment and learning.  Without free will it wouldn't be any fun, and without free will (and the pain our mistakes cause us) we couldn't learn anything.  Those two things together are, I think, the core of the purpose of life.]]></wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>Enlightenists believe in the awe-inspiring, wonder, beauty and complexity of the universe, and aspire to unpick its mysteries by reason, constant questioning, observation, experiment, and analysis of evidence. The bedrock of our morality is empathy, from which logically springs love, forgiveness, tolerance and a profound desire to make a just, egalitarian society and reduce suffering. The more knowledge a person has, the more they question and understand the real world, and the more they are required to analyse what is true then the greater the increase in empathy. Enlightenists care and wish to do good not because a vengeful God tells them to, but because intelligence suggests it is the only and the right thing to do.</blockquote>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hmmm.  I don't think one can logically claim that intelligence demands empathy or even that empathy leads to love.

It also seems that her vaunted tolerance doesn't extend to any empathy or love for those who have 'superstitious' beliefs.

Lastly, for someone that complains about religious 'whiners' she is doing a lot of whining.

That article told me more about her ignorance regarding religion than anything else.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;Hmmm. I don't think one can logically claim that intelligence demands empathy or even that empathy leads to love.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I agree with the statement about intelligence, however, empathy does indeed lead to love. When one is empathic towards others, one understands - and feels - their pain and joy. Most humans prefer joy to pain. Therefore, you would think that empathy would lead towards helping others overcome their pain, and find joy. Thus, living in a loving manner.


&lt;blockquote&gt;It also seems that her vaunted tolerance doesn't extend to any empathy or love for those who have 'superstitious' beliefs.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

She is at least allowing others to believe as they see fit. She is not saying &quot;You cannot believe want you want&quot;, but rather, &quot;Believe what you want, but question everything. And don't brainwash young kids in state sponsored schools to believe a certain way - they need to learn to think for themselves and question&quot;.

I can point out a lot of instances where religious folks have shown a major lack of empathy towards those who do not believe as they do. Up to and including killing folks and children for not believing, or having parents that do not believe. She states &quot;Children would be welcome from any religious or ideological background, with the parents only having to fulfil the brief of allowing their children to be taught in the Enlightenist manner.&quot; In other words - everyone would be welcome.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Empathy certainly can lead to love.  I question that it MUST lead to love however.  Humans being fallible, we cause pain in each other all the time.  One could imagine an empathic individual being very intolerant, even hateful to those that cause pain.

As for her tolerance, what if we reversed the equation.  A religious person who allowed you to believe what you wanted, but demanded that your kids be exposed to and even indoctrinated in their belief system would not be considered tolerant.

'Question Everything' may be a wonderful thing to be.  Objectively though it is a belief system, and it cannot be logically shown to be better or worse than any other, it can only be put above another by subject value comparisons.  I happen to be all for 'question everything' (of course my expirience with religion says that is not only not incompatible with religious faith, but demanded by religious faith) but I am not quite so arrogant to say that just because I think something is a good idea it must therefore be correct.

I can point out a lot of cases where 'folks' of all types have shown major lack of empathy.  I don't think that the 'religious' qualifier is necessary there.  Most religious people would be the first to tell you that man is a sinful creature, far from perfect.

Most Religions of course welcome everyone too.  Welcoming everyone, and being tolerant are not the same thing.  Would a religious kid in her school be 'welcome' to share their belief system with his classmates?  Would they be welcome to sing a religious hymn in the school talent show?

Secular schools in the U.S. sometimes have problems with all of these.

From what I can tell, she would tolerate those who convert.  That is hardly a high standard.]]></wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just got a huge project dropped in my lap at work. I am really busy right now. I have not died :)</p>


	<p>Expect to see some ruby code published here soon. I just got done with a DragonflyCMS/Rails authentication integration snippit - works like a charm.</p>


	<p>Just finished <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060738170?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=nwgamersorg-20&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;creativeASIN=0060738170">Misquoting Jesus: The Story Behind Who Changed the Bible and Why</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=nwgamersorg-20&#38;l=as2&#38;o=1&#38;a=0060738170" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />. Really good book. The author does a great job of balancing facts about the uncertainty in the origins of the Bible with a positive take on the message. I'd say it's a must read for any student of Christianity.</p>


	<p>I also just picked up a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1573225681?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=nwgamersorg-20&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;creativeASIN=1573225681">Living Buddha, Living Christ</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=nwgamersorg-20&#38;l=as2&#38;o=1&#38;a=1573225681" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />. I have only read one chapter it in so far, but I am very impressed.</p>


	<p>There is one story that I want to recount from it, as it sparked a lot of thought in me.</p>


	<p>It seems that one day a person asked the Buddha "How do you and your monks practice your path?".</p>


	<p>To this, the Buddha replied "We walk, we sit and we eat."</p>


	<p>"But everyone walks, sits and eats!"</p>


	<p>"However, when we walk, we know that we are walking. When we sit, we know that we are sitting, and when we eat, we know that we are eating"</p>


	<p>Being mindful of what is happening in the here and now is very important. Allowing past emotions, or future fears to rule you is counterproductive. By being fully engaged in the present, we are better parents, employees, and citizens.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Thanks for the post on my blog, tsykoduk.  I agree with wanting to read the Dead Sea Scrolls for myself!  6,000 years of recorded history in the bible is a long time.  To assume without thought or reason that all of it is 100% accurate translation requires more faith than I have, that's for sure.

I really wanted to see the DSS at the Pacific Science Center this fall, but it didn't work out time wise.  :(]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Seeing them would be cool - but I want to read them. As I understand it, they are the oldest (and thus closest to the actual words spoken) documents of the time - and include some writings that the Council of Nicea rejected for what ever reasons.

I guess that my beef with the 'bible says it, it's so' mode of thought is that we really do not know what the original writings said. They were lost in the mists of time. What we are reading is a collection of books that scribes copied and sometimes edited for content, and councils of pontiffs voted for inclusion.

Does this mean that all of the other writings from that period were 'less then' what made the grade? I would think that they failed to make it in because either some one disagreed with the theology in them, or because they did not support some one's real world aspirations.

Looking at the Bible as a collection of some of the stories that were told about Jesus, IMHO is more accurate then reading it as the literal words which came out of his mouth.

This is one of the reasons that I really like the Buddhist teaching '&lt;i&gt;Do not believe because some one tells you. Believe because you understand it to be true.&lt;/i&gt;']]></wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I think that I will have to take a trip to this museum...</p>


<blockquote>The world's first Creationist museum - dedicated to the idea that the creation of the world, as told in Genesis, is factually correct - will soon open. Stephen Bates is given a sneak preview and asks: was there really a tyrannosaurus in the Bible?...

	<p>...Theological scholars may have noticed that there are, in fact, no dinosaurs mentioned in the Bible - and here lies the Creationists' first problem. Since there are undoubtedly dinosaur bones and since, according to the Creationists, the world is only 6,000 years old - a calculation devised by the 17th-century Bishop Ussher, counting back through the Bible to the Creation, a formula more or less accepted by the museum - dinosaurs must be shoehorned in somewhere, along with the Babylonians, Egyptians and the other ancient civilisations. As for the Grand Canyon - no problem: that was, of course, created in a few months by Noah's Flood.</p>


	<p>...But what, I ask wonderingly, about those fossilised remains of early man-like creatures? Marsh knows all about that: "There are no such things. Humans are basically as you see them today. Those skeletons they've found, what's the word? ... they could have been deformed, diseased or something. I've seen people like that running round the streets of New York."...</p>


	<p>...A little licence is allowed, however, where the Bible falls down on the details. The depiction of a wall-sized section of Noah's Ark is based, not on the traditional picture of a flat-decked boat, but one designed by navy engineers with a keel and bows, which might, at least, have floated. "You can surmise," says Marsh. When you get inside, there's nifty computer software telling you how they fitted all the animals in, too....</blockquote></p>


	<p>You know, this really speaks for it's self. But I still want to know - How did they fit 2 of each of the <a href="http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2003/FelixNisimov.shtml">between 2 and 100 million species</a> in a boat?</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>You think this is silly, and it is, but a week ago my mother caused a small commotion at a checkpoint at Boston-Logan after screeners discovered a large container of homemade tomato sauce in her bag. What with the preponderance of spaghetti grenades and lasagna bombs, we can all be proud of their vigilance. And, as a liquid, tomato sauce is in clear violation of the Transportation Security Administration's carry-on statutes. But this time, there was a wrinkle: The sauce was frozen.

	<p>No longer in its liquid state, the sauce had the guards in a scramble. According to my mother's account, a supervisor was called over to help assess the situation. He spent several moments stroking his chin. "He struck me as the type of person who spent most of his life traveling with the circus," says Mom, who never pulls a punch, "and was only vaguely familiar with the concept of refrigeration." Nonetheless, drawing from his experiences in grade-school chemistry and at the <span class="caps">TSA</span> academy, he sized things up. "It's not a liquid right now," he observantly noted. "But it will be soon."</blockquote></p>

	<p>-<a href="http://www.millerandlevine.com/km/evol/">Ken Miller</a></p>


	<p>I really think that the evidence is mounting which shows that Evolution is the theory that best explains our origins. We are reaching the point where to believe in Intelligent Design or Creationism is hard to justify.</p>


<blockquote>
	<p>There are those who scoff at the school boy, calling him frivolous and shallow. Yet it was the
	school boy who said, Faith is believing what you know ain't so.</p>

</blockquote>

	<p>-<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Twain">Mark Twain</a> in <i>Following the Equator, Pudd'nhead Wilson's Calendar</i></p>


	<p>I understand how hard it can be to release concepts that one is attached to. As we 'build our faith' in something, we allow it to become almost part of us. We are bound to it, and when it is challenged, it can actually cause us harm. Even Christianity talks about this. '<i>Let go, let God</i>' comes to mind.</p>


	<p>To state 'This is what I believe' is a wonderful thing. To then never budge from that belief when presented with evidence, empirical or logical, which refutes that belief is closed minded. Our paradigm or world view is colored by all of our experiences. It is safe to say that we are not the same person that we were a day ago, or even 5 minutes ago. Each experience that we have changes our core being in ways that we cannot fathom. To say 'This I Believe now and forever' is to stay a caterpillar, never transcending into the next state of being.</p>


<blockquote> The Buddhist texts refer to four strands of grasping (<em>upaadaana</em>): grasping of sense pleasures (<em>kaamupaadaana</em>), <strong>of views (<em>di.t.thuupaadaana</em>), of rule and custom (<em>siilabbatupaadaana</em>), of doctrines of self (<em>attavaadupaadaana</em>).</strong> All of these can also be described as forms of <em>raaga</em> or desire. To destroy their power over the human psyche, attachment to them must be transformed into non-attachment. Non-attachment or non-grasping would therefore flow from the awareness that no possession, no relationship, no achievement is permanent or able to give lasting satisfaction; from the discovery that there is no self which needs to be protected, promoted, or defended; and from the realization that searching for selfish sensual gratification is pointless, since it leads only to craving and obsession.</blockquote>

	<p>-<a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/harris/bl141.html">Elizabeth J. Harris</a></p>


	<p>(e<em>mphasis mine</em>)</p>


	<p>I think that it is like having a rope tied to yourself and a big horse. That horse is traveling away from you at a steady, but slow rate. When you are 'grasping', you firmly plant you're feet and refuse to budge. This will be fine for a time, but when the pressure builds, it starts to become painful. As the rope tightens, your fists start to get crushed, and your torso squeezed.</p>


	<p>Would it not be much better to simply give in to the change, and walk with the horse?</p>]]></content:encoded>

<title>Polymorphic associations in Rails</title>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a project that I am working on, I finally needed to dig into polymorphic associations in Rails Models.</p>


	<p>If you just thought to yourself '<em>Hu? <span class="caps">WTH</span> is this freak talking about?</em>' let me give you a little background.</p>


	<p>Rails is built around a '<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller"><span class="caps">MVC</span></a>' model of programming. So, each program is logically broken up into three parts - The Model (the data), The View (the part the user interacts with) and the Controller, (the part that interacts between the data and the the user).</p>


	<p>Delving into the model - chunks of data can have some sort of relationship. For example, an address could be associated with a person. People could have many addresses (home, work, favorite bar). In railspeak, that is called a has_many relationship. People has_many addresses, and addresses belongs_to people. However, we can get into problems - dogs have addresses to. They tend to live in a house with people, and you can send them mail. So - let's see what this looks like:</p>


<table class="CodeRay"><tr>
  <td class="line_numbers" title="click to toggle" onclick="with (this.firstChild.style) { display = (display == '') ? 'none' : '' }"><pre>1<tt>
</tt>2<tt>
</tt>3<tt>
</tt>4<tt>
</tt></pre></td>
  <td class="code"><pre ondblclick="with (this.style) { overflow = (overflow == 'auto' || overflow == '') ? 'visible' : 'auto' }"><span class="r">class</span> <span class="cl">Address</span> &lt; <span class="co">ActiveRecord</span>::<span class="co">Base</span><tt>
</tt>  belongs_to <span class="sy">:person</span><tt>
</tt>  belongs_to <span class="sy">:dog</span><tt>
</tt><span class="r">end</span></pre></td>
</tr></table>


	<p>But the problem with that is that an address belongs to <strong>both</strong> a person and a dog. What about those happy homes who have no dogs? Or that have a cat, instead? we need a belongs_to 'or' statement.</p>


	<p>Enter the polymorph.</p>


<table class="CodeRay"><tr>
  <td class="line_numbers" title="click to toggle" onclick="with (this.firstChild.style) { display = (display == '') ? 'none' : '' }"><pre>1<tt>
</tt>2<tt>
</tt>3<tt>
</tt></pre></td>
  <td class="code"><pre ondblclick="with (this.style) { overflow = (overflow == 'auto' || overflow == '') ? 'visible' : 'auto' }"><span class="r">class</span> <span class="cl">Address</span> &lt; <span class="co">ActiveRecord</span>::<span class="co">Base</span><tt>
</tt>  belongs_to <span class="sy">:owner</span>, <span class="sy">:polymorphic</span> =&gt; <span class="pc">true</span><tt>
</tt><span class="r">end</span></pre></td>
</tr></table>


	<p>This says an address belongs to a class of thing called <em>owner</em>. It will look for two columns in the database : owner_type (to record what model owns that record) and owner_id (to record the id of the model that owns it).</p>


	<p>So, now we have the address all set up! But, what about the other side? How do we tell the people, dogs and cats that they can have an address?</p>


<table class="CodeRay"><tr>
  <td class="line_numbers" title="click to toggle" onclick="with (this.firstChild.style) { display = (display == '') ? 'none' : '' }"><pre>1<tt>
</tt>2<tt>
</tt>3<tt>
</tt></pre></td>
  <td class="code"><pre ondblclick="with (this.style) { overflow = (overflow == 'auto' || overflow == '') ? 'visible' : 'auto' }"><span class="r">class</span> <span class="cl">Person</span> &lt; <span class="co">ActiveRecord</span>::<span class="co">Base</span><tt>
</tt>  has_many <span class="sy">:address</span> <tt>
</tt><span class="r">end</span></pre></td>
</tr></table>


	<p>This is how we tell rails that a person could <em>have many</em> addresses, Rails would expect to find a column called person_id in the addresses table. However, there is not a column called person_id, as the address model does not belong to an person. Addresses belong to owners. How do we tell Rails that it should find all of the addresses for owner type 'person' where the id is what ever the id number is?</p>


	<p>Well, Rails has a way. Imagine that.</p>


<table class="CodeRay"><tr>
  <td class="line_numbers" title="click to toggle" onclick="with (this.firstChild.style) { display = (display == '') ? 'none' : '' }"><pre>1<tt>
</tt>2<tt>
</tt>3<tt>
</tt></pre></td>
  <td class="code"><pre ondblclick="with (this.style) { overflow = (overflow == 'auto' || overflow == '') ? 'visible' : 'auto' }"><span class="r">class</span> <span class="cl">Person</span> &lt; <span class="co">ActiveRecord</span>::<span class="co">Base</span><tt>
</tt>has_many <span class="sy">:address</span> <span class="sy">:as</span> =&gt; <span class="sy">:owner</span><tt>
</tt><span class="r">end</span></pre></td>
</tr></table>


	<p>So now, we in people_controller we can say things like:</p>


<table class="CodeRay"><tr>
  <td class="line_numbers" title="click to toggle" onclick="with (this.firstChild.style) { display = (display == '') ? 'none' : '' }"><pre>1<tt>
</tt>2<tt>
</tt>3<tt>
</tt>4<tt>
</tt></pre></td>
  <td class="code"><pre ondblclick="with (this.style) { overflow = (overflow == 'auto' || overflow == '') ? 'visible' : 'auto' }"><span class="r">def</span> <span class="fu">find_addy</span> ()<tt>
</tt>  <span class="iv">@dog</span> = <span class="co">Site</span>.find_by_id(params[<span class="sy">:id</span>])<tt>
</tt>  <span class="iv">@address</span> = <span class="iv">@dog</span>.address<tt>
</tt><span class="r">end</span></pre></td>
</tr></table>


	<p>The @dog.address will automagically return us the address associated with the site contained in @dog. We can also say other cool things like @dog.address.create, which will create a new address associated with the site in @dog.</p>


And, if we later decide to add cats to the mix, we simply add
<table class="CodeRay"><tr>
  <td class="line_numbers" title="click to toggle" onclick="with (this.firstChild.style) { display = (display == '') ? 'none' : '' }"><pre><tt>
</tt></pre></td>
  <td class="code"><pre ondblclick="with (this.style) { overflow = (overflow == 'auto' || overflow == '') ? 'visible' : 'auto' }">has_many <span class="sy">:address</span>, <span class="sy">:as</span> =&gt; <span class="sy">:owner</span></pre></td>
</tr></table>


	<p>to the Cat model, and Bam! Chili fries!</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>Well I've been hiding a secret for the past two weeks. It's something that I've felt conflicted and unsure of, something that I've felt ashamed of and proud of at the same time. Something that I've been trying to sort out before I actually wrote about it. Most people will probably say, "yeah, big deal." But for me it kind of is a big deal. I haven't told very many people. I showed Robert Scoble last week but have been kind of hiding it otherwise.

	<p>A little over two weeks ago I walked into the Apple store in Palo Alto and bought myself a new MacBook Pro. Yes, the new sexy Intel dual core MacBook Pro. And I went home and after not using a Mac for over 15 years, put my Dell PC notebook literally in the bookshelf and have been using this new Mac as my primary computer for the past 2 weeks.</blockquote></p>


	<p>-<a href="http://thomashawk.com/">Thomas Hawk</a> via <a href="http://www.apple.com/hotnews/">Apple</a></p>


	<p>Another story from a switcher.</p>


	<p>I am forced to use a Dell laptop at work - and I must say that I hate it. I even have gotten to play around with their Dual Core d620 - and it just makes me want to use my trusty G4 Powerbook all the more. It's not just bigotry here - I actually prefer how the Powerbook works, and feels. When I hold the Dell, and it flexes it just feels like a toy - not a tool. When I hold the powerbook, it's solid and feels like it's there.</p>


	<p>They keyboards are also very different. I am very aware of the tactile response that a keyboard provides. The Dell's keyboard feels - well, cheap. My fingers catch the undersides of the keys, and there is very little travel in the keys. The mac laptop is tight, back lit, and when you press a key, it travels up and down fluidly with a just about the perfect tactile feedback.</p>


	<p>It's these little things that have really make the experience work for me. It makes working with the device more of a pleasure then a chore.</p>]]></content:encoded>

	<p>Sounds like yet another major woops from Microsoft. Have they released a patch yet? Nope. Their advice is :</p>


<blockquote>that users 'not open or save Word files,' even from trusted sources.</blockquote>

	<p>So, shut down Word. Take a break. Drink some of your favorite frosty warm beverage. Wait for Microsoft to issue a patch.</p>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At work, we run two <a href="">DragonflyCMS</a> sites (soon to become <a href="">Nexos</a>). As I do not do much in php except hack, when I was tasked with writing an application which used the authentication token generated by the DragonflyCMS site, I decided to do it in Ruby/Ruby on Rails. This posed a bit of a question. How do I check authentication and get the username out of a <span class="caps">PHP</span> based application?</p>


	<p>The Rails Wiki had a good article on checking authentication vs a phpBB site, and that gave me the springboard that I needed.</p>


	<p>I created a user, group, user_group and session model as follows:</p>


<table class="CodeRay"><tr>
  <td class="line_numbers" title="click to toggle" onclick="with (this.firstChild.style) { display = (display == '') ? 'none' : '' }"><pre>1<tt>
</tt>2<tt>

</tt>8<tt>
</tt>9<tt>
</tt><strong>10</strong><tt>
</tt>11<tt>
</tt>12<tt>
</tt>13<tt>
</tt>14<tt>
</tt><strong>15</strong><tt>
</tt></pre></td>
  <td class="code"><pre ondblclick="with (this.style) { overflow = (overflow == 'auto' || overflow == '') ? 'visible' : 'auto' }"><span class="r">class</span> <span class="cl">User</span> &lt; <span class="co">ActiveRecord</span>::<span class="co">Base</span><tt>

</tt> <span class="r">end</span></pre></td>
</tr></table>


	<p>This allows us to connect to the DragonflyCMS database, and get information about the users, groups and sessions. I pulled this directly from the wonderful wiki article.</p>


	<p>As per the wiki, I set up a before filter in my application.rb - but I had to modify it quite a bit..</p>


<table class="CodeRay"><tr>
  <td class="line_numbers" title="click to toggle" onclick="with (this.firstChild.style) { display = (display == '') ? 'none' : '' }"><pre>1<tt>
</tt>2<tt>
</tt>3<tt>
</tt>4<tt>
</tt><strong>5</strong><tt>
</tt></pre></td>
  <td class="code"><pre ondblclick="with (this.style) { overflow = (overflow == 'auto' || overflow == '') ? 'visible' : 'auto' }">   before_filter <span class="sy">:has_session</span><tt>
</tt><tt>
</tt>   <span class="r">def</span> <span class="fu">has_session</span>()<tt>
</tt><tt>
</tt>      <span class="r">if</span> session[<span class="sy">:user_id</span>].nil?<tt>
</tt></pre></td>
</tr></table>


	<p>We have run the before filter and started the module to check the authentication. One of the things that I decided to do differently was check to see if we already had a session or not. It seemed to me that we could save some time by bypassing all of the work below if we already had the session set up. Now, we are read in the cookie:</p>


<table class="CodeRay"><tr>
  <td class="line_numbers" title="click to toggle" onclick="with (this.firstChild.style) { display = (display == '') ? 'none' : '' }"><pre>1<tt>
</tt></pre></td>
  <td class="code"><pre ondblclick="with (this.style) { overflow = (overflow == 'auto' || overflow == '') ? 'visible' : 'auto' }">         sid = <span class="co">Base64</span>.decode64(cookies[<span class="sy">:my_login</span>]).split(<span class="s"><span class="dl">'</span><span class="k">:</span><span class="dl">'</span></span>)<tt>
</tt></pre></td>
</tr></table>


	<p>DragonflyCMS uses base64 encoding for it's cookies, and also uses a ':' as a field delimiter. So, we read the cookie in, decode it, and split it. We know that the user ID is the first field in the cookie, so we can do this:</p>


<table class="CodeRay"><tr>
  <td class="line_numbers" title="click to toggle" onclick="with (this.firstChild.style) { display = (display == '') ? 'none' : '' }"><pre>1<tt>
</tt>2<tt>
</tt>3<tt>
</tt></pre></td>
  <td class="code"><pre ondblclick="with (this.style) { overflow = (overflow == 'auto' || overflow == '') ? 'visible' : 'auto' }">        t = <span class="co">User</span>.find_by_user_id(sid[<span class="i">0</span>])<tt>
</tt><tt>
</tt>        <span class="r">if</span> s = <span class="co">Sessions</span>.find_by_uname(t.username)</pre></td>
</tr></table>


	<p>We take the user ID out of the cookie, and cross reference it with the Users model to insure that the user really exists in the DragonflyCMS system. We then check if the username has a active session in the sessions table, and presto! we have a live user who is authenticated vs the dragonfly system.</p>


<table class="CodeRay"><tr>
  <td class="line_numbers" title="click to toggle" onclick="with (this.firstChild.style) { display = (display == '') ? 'none' : '' }"><pre>1<tt>

	<p>That huge chunk of code does a lot of stuff!</p>


	<p>First, since we have a live user, we want to check to see if they have logged into our application before. I have a model called 'Person' which contains some information about the user that this application needs.</p>


	<p>If they have not logged in before, we build them a new person object, and dump them into their edit page so they can fill out all of the neato little fields.</p>


	<p>If they have logged in before, we create the session information in Rails which will allow us to authenticate them vs various models and functions as we need to.</p>


<table class="CodeRay"><tr>
  <td class="line_numbers" title="click to toggle" onclick="with (this.firstChild.style) { display = (display == '') ? 'none' : '' }"><pre>1<tt>
</tt>2<tt>
</tt>3<tt>
</tt>4<tt>
</tt><strong>5</strong><tt>
</tt></pre></td>
  <td class="code"><pre ondblclick="with (this.style) { overflow = (overflow == 'auto' || overflow == '') ? 'visible' : 'auto' }">         <span class="r">else</span><tt>
</tt>            session[<span class="sy">:user_id</span>] = <span class="pc">nil</span><tt>
</tt>         <span class="r">end</span><tt>
</tt>      <span class="r">end</span><tt>
</tt>   <span class="r">end</span></pre></td>
</tr></table>


	<p>If all else fails, we make the session information read Nil, so that next time a page loads or what have you, we check again to make sure that the have not logged in elsewhere.</p>


	<p>I also have been thinking about ways of increasing security. DragonflyCMS records the IP address of the session's user - it would be trivial to cross check that as well to insure that the cookie is not forged. As this application resides on an intranet, I have not implemented that level of cross-checking yet, but probably will in the future.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bruce Schneier has an interesting <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2006/12/realworld_passw.html">article</a> posted about real world password strength. He bases his findings off of a list of passwords recovered from a phishing attempt on MySpace. Well worth reading...</p>


<blockquote>How good are the passwords people are choosing to protect their computers and online accounts?

	<p>It's a hard question to answer because data is scarce. But recently, a colleague sent me some spoils from a MySpace phishing attack: 34,000 actual user names and passwords.</p>


	<p>The attack was pretty basic. The attackers created a fake MySpace login page, and collected login information when users thought they were accessing their own account on the site. The data was forwarded to various compromised web servers, where the attackers would harvest it later.</p>


	<p>MySpace estimates that more than 100,000 people fell for the attack before it was shut down. The data I have is from two different collection points, and was cleaned of the small percentage of people who realized they were responding to a phishing attack. I analyzed the data, and this is what I learned.</blockquote></p>]]></content:encoded>

<guid isPermaLink="false">30/2008/12/27/windows-vista-content-protection-specification</guid>
<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href = "http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/" >Peter Gutmann</a> wrote an <a href = "http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/pubs/vista_cost.txt" >interesting article</a> about Windows Vista's content protection protocols that really deserves a good read...</p>

<blockquote>Windows Vista includes an extensive reworking of core OS elements in order to provide content protection for so-called "premium content", typically HD data from Blu-Ray and HD-DVD sources.  Providing this protection incurs considerable costs in terms of system performance, system stability, technical support overhead, and hardware and software cost.  These issues affect not only users of Vista but the entire PC industry, since the effects of the protection measures extend to cover all hardware and software that will ever come into contact with Vista, even if it's not used directly with Vista (for example hardware in a Macintosh computer or on a Linux server).  This document analyses the cost involved in Vista's content protection, and the collateral damage that this incurs throughout the computer industry.</blockquote>

<p>Some of the details in the article are down right scary, for example</p>

<blockquote>Once a weakness is found in a particular driver or device, that driver will have its signature revoked by Microsoft, which means that it will cease to function (details on this are a bit vague here, presumably some minimum functionality like generic 640x480 VGA support will still be available in order for the system to boot).  This means that a report of a compromise of a particular driver or device will cause all support for that device worldwide to be turned off until a fix can be found.</blockquote>

<p>Read that last sentence again. This cannot be true, can it?</p>

<p>Yes, it is. According to Microsoft's White Paper, <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fdownload.microsoft.com%2Fdownload%2Fa%2Ff%2F7%2Faf7777e5-7dcd-4800-8a0a-b18336565f5b%2Fpnp-driver.doc&amp;ei=3kyMRZzaLqiUgAOY9tigDw&amp;usg=__eFShNs4H156r9HezjkpUnMRAuiQ=&amp;sig2=slDaITf7O8Z3UCecdzcW7g">Driver Package Integrity during Plug and Play Device Installations in Windows Vista</a></p>

<blockquote>If users want to play next-generation premium content on Windows Vista, such as HD DVD and other formats that are licensed under the Advanced Access Content System (AACS) specification, all kernel-mode components on their system must be signed. That means that, if an administrative user chooses to install an unsigned or altered driver, the system is not allowed to play premium content</blockquote>

<p>Wow.</p>

<p>Choose anything but Vista. Run as fast as you can from it. Microsoft of Borg is coming, and they think they own your hardware.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, and Merry Christmas!</p>

<p><i>Update</i></p>

<p>I was thinking more about this. I wanted to take a second and explain it more directly.</p>

<p>1) I buy a high end sound card, who's manufacturer has not payed the Microsoft tax, so their driver is not signed by Microsoft.</p>

<p>2) I buy some Microsoft designated 'premium content' - say Jose and the Pussycats on Blue-ray.</p>

<p>3) I play my new Blue-ray disc on my computer with the OS that I bought.</p>

<p>No sound. </p>

<p>Microsoft has not blessed the folks who built my sound card with a certificate, so Microsoft decides that I cannot play the movie that I bought on the computer that I bought, using the OS that I payed good money for.</p>

<p>Uh. No. Sorry - I will not play <b>that</b> game. If I buy a freaking movie, I want to watch it on the hardware that I choose.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So... in between heaps of code, I was reminiscing about the old days when I was a <span class="caps">BBS</span> geek. The most memorable <span class="caps">BBS</span> that I was on was called Club Fresno. It had about 30 phone lines, and was a true trend setter for it's day - a multi-line <span class="caps">BBS</span>. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Club%20Fresno%22%20bbs&#38;sourceid=mozilla2&#38;ie=utf-8&#38;oe=utf-8">Google to the rescue</a>. Heh. I only found two mentions of good ol' club Fres out there - one blog post by an <a href="http://debicollinsworth.blogspot.com/2005/07/ode-to-sister.html">ex-member</a> and a <a href="http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&#38;friendid=118109418">My Space</a> profile.</p>


	<p>So, here's a third result about Club Fresno, the Multi Line <span class="caps">BBS</span>.</p>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am sure that all of the programmers out there will say "Well, Duh!" but I wanted to put this into writing for my own purposes. Basically so I do not forget it. If you happen to get some good ideas from it, well then score.</p>


	<p>So, I have several models which all need to have attributes. Not all of them need the same attributes, however we want a method of quickly searching and creating new types of attributes for models.</p>


	<p>Hu?</p>


	<p>Ok...</p>


	<p>Suppose we have the following models:</p>


<ul>
 <li>Laptop </li>
 <li>Desktop </li>
 <li>Server </li>
 <li>Person </li>
 <li>Building </li>
</ul>

	<p>All of these might have a attribute of color, but only the computers will have an IP Address. However, we want to be able to search all computers based on the IP address. Just to make it more difficult, Laptops, Servers and Desktops are all computers.</p>


	<p>My solution at this time is to create another model, which I have called Attributes. This has the following layout:</p>


<table class="CodeRay"><tr>
  <td class="line_numbers" title="click to toggle" onclick="with (this.firstChild.style) { display = (display == '') ? 'none' : '' }"><pre>1<tt>
</tt>2<tt>
</tt>3<tt>
</tt>4<tt>
</tt><strong>5</strong><tt>
</tt>6<tt>
</tt>7<tt>
</tt>8<tt>
</tt>9<tt>
</tt><strong>10</strong><tt>
</tt></pre></td>
  <td class="code"><pre ondblclick="with (this.style) { overflow = (overflow == 'auto' || overflow == '') ? 'visible' : 'auto' }"><span class="r">class</span> <span class="cl">Attribute</span> &lt; <span class="co">ActiveRecord</span>::<span class="co">Base</span><tt>
</tt>  belongs_to <span class="sy">:owner</span>, <span class="sy">:polymorphic</span> =&gt; <span class="sy">:true</span><tt>
</tt>  <tt>
</tt> <span class="c"># Attribute has the following fields:</span><tt>
</tt> <span class="c"># owner_type as string</span><tt>
</tt> <span class="c"># owner_id as integer</span><tt>
</tt> <span class="c"># type as string</span><tt>
</tt> <span class="c"># value as string</span><tt>
</tt><tt>
</tt> <span class="r">end</span></pre></td>
</tr></table>


	<p>Each of my models which will use these will include the has_many directive:</p>


<table class="CodeRay"><tr>
  <td class="line_numbers" title="click to toggle" onclick="with (this.firstChild.style) { display = (display == '') ? 'none' : '' }"><pre><tt>
</tt></pre></td>
  <td class="code"><pre ondblclick="with (this.style) { overflow = (overflow == 'auto' || overflow == '') ? 'visible' : 'auto' }"> has_many <span class="sy">:attribute</span>, <span class="sy">:as</span> =&gt; <span class="sy">:owner</span></pre></td>
</tr></table>


	<p>When a new instance of a model is created, I run an after_create function (which I cleverly call Templater) which figures out which type (or species) of model is being created, and pre-populates a default set of attributes.</p>


	<p>For example, a Laptop might be created with the attributes: <span class="caps">CPU</span>, RAM, IP Address, and OS. In fact, all computers could be created with that same default set of attributes. Then, when we decide to build a query that gives us all computers with less them 1024 megs of <span class="caps">RAM</span>, we can simply search the attributes table for all records where type is <span class="caps">RAM</span> and value is less then 1024, and return their owner ID's.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Microsoft has a new search interface - <a href="http://www.msdewey.com/">Ms. Dewey</a>.</p>


	<p>This is bad UI design on so many levels. First off, it gets annoying in about 35.3 seconds. Secondly, it's a freaking pig. Slow, slow slow. And, to top it all off, you only get a few results after putting up with Ms. Dewey's lame jokes.</p>


	<p>I think that this really underscores how Microsoft views their consumers. They know best, and we just have to sit down, shut up and ride. I for one want off that wacky roller coaster.</p>


	<p>When are they going to realize, on Mount Redmond, that the consumer is fed up with crappy, insecure, poorly designed, not thought out bloatware?</p>


	<p>If you had a choice between a glitzy car, with all the bells and whistles, which would break down every 100 or so miles, or a sleek, well designed 100 mile to the gallon virtually indestructible car, or a free tank, which one would you choose? (read <a href="http://www.cryptonomicon.com/beginning.html">this</a> to get the analogy, and a good history of computers and the IT industry)</p>


	<p>I for one, use tanks for my servers, and sleek machines for my laptops.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The theme that this site displays right now is Sharp333 - a modification of <a href="http://dairon.net/2006/12/19/mephisto-theme-called-sharp000">Sharp000</a>. I made the following changes:</p>


<ul>
<li> DRY'd up the code by splitting the main theme template out into layout.liquid, header.liquid, footer.liquid and sidebar.liquid.</li>
<li>Added an 'about' page</li>
<li>Transmogrified the layout from Fixed Width to Liquid</li>
<li>Added Coderay <span class="caps">CSS</span> support for code display</li>
<li>Futz'd with the verbage a wee bit in a few places</li>
<li>Tweaked the <span class="caps">CSS</span> layout a wee bit</a>
</ul>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<script type="text/javascript" src="http://tv.netscape.com/embed/480/CCTJOEIEFLKBXHIVPSSQ"></script>

	<p>This is actually a very good video. That's one of the things that I like about Boston Legal -  every once in a while they slip some good social commentary into the show.</p>


	<p>Most organizations should take this to heart. How many really leverage their technology? Google does. Microsoft does, Apple does.</p>


	<p>Technology should be an enabler. We are past the point where location independent computing is a reality - however not many people make use of that paradigm. Technology should act as a 'force multiplier'. It should enable you to get more done with less.</p>


	<p>In many of the organizations that I have worked with, this is just not true. Technology detracts from the work flow, or even worse, technology dictates the work flow. Take for example, <span class="caps">SAP</span>. You have to restructure your business around how their application works. An application should not dictate how you run your organization, rather, your origination should dictate how the applications work.</p>


	<p>Now days, with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_application_development"><span class="caps">RAD</span></a> tools such as <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a>, a competent coder should be able to have a baseline beta application out the door fairly quickly. No longer are folks forced to shoehorn <a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/C/COTS.html"><span class="caps">COTS</span></a> software into their business model. Now days, just about everyone can have their own vertical application space created, quickly and efficiently.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is an interesting thread over at NWGamers. It's not really about Gaming, so I have requested that the fascinating discussion move over here, so I am cross posting my last response here.</p>


<blockquote>Ye shall utterly destroy all the places, wherein the nations which ye shall possess served their gods, upon the high mountains, and upon the hills, and under every green tree: And ye shall overthrow their altars, and break their pillars, and burn their groves with fire; and ye shall hew down the graven images of their gods, and destroy the names of them out of that place.</blockquote>

	<p>Deuteronomy 12:2-3</p>


	<p>Um. Loving. Nice. Kill everyone who does not agree? This must be a mistake.</p>


<blockquote> The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance: he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked.

</blockquote>

	<p>Psalms 58:10</p>


	<p>Wait a minute. God, the God of Love expects His followers to rejoice when he 'washes his feet in the blood of the wicked'? <span class="caps">WTH</span>?</p>


<blockquote>Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword. For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law. And a man's foes shall be they of his own household.</blockquote>

	<p>Matthew 10:34-37</p>


	<p>There goes the idea the Jesus is a peaceful guy.</p>


	<p>As far as folks using Christianity as a basis for murder:</p>


<blockquote>My feelings as a Christian points me to my Lord and Savior as a fighter. It points me to the man who once in loneliness, surrounded only by a few followers, recognized these Jews for what they were and summoned men to fight against them and who, God's truth! was greatest not as a sufferer but as a fighter. In boundless love as a Christian and as a man I read through the passage which tells us how the Lord at last rose in His might and seized the scourge to drive out of the Temple the brood of vipers and adders. How terrific was His fight for the world against the Jewish poison. To-day, after two thousand years, with deepest emotion I recognize more profoundly than ever before in the fact that it was for this that He had to shed His blood upon the Cross. As a Christian I have no duty to allow myself to be cheated, but I have the duty to be a fighter for truth and justice.... And if there is anything which could demonstrate that we are acting rightly it is the distress that daily grows. For as a Christian I have also a duty to my own people.... When I go out in the morning and see these men standing in their queues and look into their pinched faces, then I believe I would be no Christian, but a very devil if I felt no pity for them, if I did not, as did our Lord two thousand years ago, turn against those by whom to-day this poor people is plundered and exploited. </blockquote>

	<p>That was Hitler. Yup. <a href="http://nobeliefs.com/speeches.htm">Adolf Hitler, in his speech on 12 April 1922</a>.</p>


	<p>All of this just goes to say that, just about any religion can be used 'for evil', or at the very least to rationalize the use of Evil. It has been said that God is the basis for all evil. I do not know if I believe that or not, however 'His' writings can certainly be used to justify Evil.</p>


	<p>And it's not just a Muslim thing.</p>


	<p>I think that this needs to move to a non-gaming site, as it is not really in the scope of the site. I will cross post this to my Blog, and you can feel free to flame me there.</p>


	<p>Thanks! :)</p>]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[So we change website and topic all in one go.  I can't see how we can debate when this moral equivalancy argument was already presented and both of us agreed it had no relavance but here it is again.  And of course I have never said &quot;muslims have a monopoly on using their religion for evil&quot; but I am pointing out that Islam seems to be embroiled in &quot;Jihad&quot; in almost all the current conflicts going on in the world.  So I guess your steering the Topic not only off topic but out of the time line...shall we go back to the dawn of ages to find out if christians sinned more and what relevance would that have?

Of course I'll bite since the 3 versus you gave from the Bible are out of context.  And reading this post would not be entertaining if I didn't.

Deuteronomy 12:2-3 , this was a commandment for the Jews as to how they were to take the 'promise landâ€ and not an outstanding commandment such as Jihad in the Koran.  Of course if you read the whole book you realise that Israel did not obey this commandment and fell into idoletry as a result.

Matthew 10:34-37 , this one is way out of context when you read the chapter.  He is talking about how preaching the gospel will get his disciples persecuted because of their relationship with him and by telling others about how they too can have this relationship.  Thats why in Matthew 10:21-23 it says '21&quot;Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child; children will rebel against their parents and have them put to death. 22  All men will hate you because of me, but he who stands firm to the end will be saved. 23  When you are persecuted in one place, flee to another. I tell you the truth, you will not finish going through the cities of Israel before the Son of Man comes.â€  Again not a commandment for Jihad

Psalms 58:10 , of course this is a song (a miktam) talking about the judgment the rulers of the world (as it states in the first verse) and it is also repeated in the Revelation 19.  It is talking about a future event when the age of 'graceâ€ is over and Christ returns to 'judgeâ€ the world.  Its not a Jihad  commandment.

Hitlers speech you quoted is built on three lies

1.Hitler was not a christian.  He just said that to let the christians know he could relate to them.
[quote=â€Hitlers Table Talkâ€]
&quot;National Socialism and religion cannot exist together....
&quot;The heaviest blow that ever struck humanity was the coming of Christianity. Bolshevism is  Christianity's illegitimate child. Both are inventions of the Jew. The deliberate lie in the matter of religion was introduced into the world by Christianity....
&quot;Let it not be said that Christianity brought man the life of the soul, for that evolution was in the natural order of things.&quot; [/quote]
2.Jesus did not die on the cross to ward the world 'against the Jewish poisonâ€.  1 Chorinthians 15, Hebrews 9:15, 1 Peter 3:18, etc...
3.Christ did not 'recognized these Jews for what they were and summoned men to fight against themâ€


And of course this is a far cry from

[quote]&quot;Allah on 480 occasions in the Holy Koran extols Muslims to wage jihad. We only fulfil God's orders. Only jihad can bring peace to the world,&quot; he says.

The militant leader on several occasions in the past had openly admitted crossing over into Afghanistan to fight foreign troops.

&quot;We will continue our struggle until foreign troops are thrown out. Then we will attack them in the US and Britain until they either accept Islam or agree to pay jazia (a tax in Islam for non-Muslims living in an Islamic state).&quot;[/quote]

source is here: http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6292061.stm

He is basically summerizing this text in the Koran.

[quote]9:29 Fight those who believe not in God nor the Last Day, nor hold that forbidden which hath been forbidden by God and His Apostle, nor acknowledge the religion of Truth, (even if they are) of the People of the Book, until they pay the Jizya [tribute] with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued.[/quote] ]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I think that the main point here is when you start quoting snippets out of a book, taken out of context, you can use that book to justify just about anything. Add to that the book being thousands of years old, and translated and copied by hand literally hundreds of times since the original - well let's just say that I could use a Warhammer rule book to justify a peaceful and loving religion.

One of the issues that we deal with, being citizens of this world, is people who do not agree with our ideas. In the American paradigm they have every right to disagree with us, and to talk about those disagreements. In fact, since every religious text is interpreted, with out the possibility of discussion of dispirit ideas, we would basically be at a stand still. Belief is a dangerous thing, and when presented with notions that do not agree with one's belief, that which one has build their entire world-view around, one tends to react defensively.

To have a group of us decide what is considered 'hate speech' and to make speech such as that illegal, well, I have a problem with that. If it can be proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that the speech in question lead &lt;strong&gt;directly&lt;/strong&gt; to the actions, and that the person who carried out the actions was unduly swayed by said speech, let's prosecute under the existing laws which cover that. We simply do not need to make more things illegal, or write new laws. We already have the ability to take care of the criminal problem. Let's use what we do have.

So called political correctness (protecting the feelings of a group by making certain speech) is an anathema to American Values. Values inshrined in our constitution such as free speech. To loose those values to PC laws and fear, well that's &lt;strong&gt;loosing&lt;/strong&gt; the war.

&lt;blockquote&gt;he idea that any kind of free society can be constructed in which people will never be offended or insulted is absurd. So too is the notion that people should have the right to call on the law to defend them against being offended or insulted. A fundamental decision needs to be made: do we want to live in a free society or not? Democracy is not a tea party where people sit around making polite conversation. In democracies people get extremely upset with each other. They argue vehemently against each other's positions. (But they don't shoot.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

--&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opendemocracy.net/faith-europe_islam/article_2331.jsp&quot;&gt;Salman Rushdie&lt;/a&gt;

My though is when people &lt;strong&gt;do&lt;/strong&gt; shoot, they should be treated like the criminals that they are.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Actually the &quot;snippets&quot; I posted were in context to an Islamis Extremist.  In fact thats why I provided you a statement made to the press and compared it to the Koran...I was pointing out were an extremist gets this stuff because the question posed to me in the beggining was &quot;Hey we should understand our enemy...&quot; and this goes to motive (these &quot;snippets&quot; explain why they want to kill us).

At any rate I find it amusing that hate crime laws were introduced and used with great success against such organizations as KKK, Aryan Nations, etc... and I am wondering why is there reluctance to use the same laws against extremist Islamist?  I mean whats on their agenda...they hate Jews and they hate non-believers.

You can say what you want about free speach but the fact remains that none of the 19 hijackers of 9/11 were ever prosecuted nore will they ever serve a day in jail for killing anyone.  In fact they will never be treated like criminals.

So at what point does &quot;free&quot; speach become a threat and should anyone be &quot;free&quot; to make someone else live in fear with those threats?  Living in fear is not really free.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[&quot;I think that the snippets that you provided are not 'why' 'they' want to kill us, but rather justification used by their leaders to brainwash their followers.

If we (as the west) decide that all Muslims are evil, as it seems to me is happening, the only thing that we can do is kill all of them. Genocide.

I cannot believe that genocide is any kind of a solution to the tensions that we are facing.

We simply have to educate people that they &lt;strong&gt;do not have the right to not be offended&lt;/strong&gt;. It's that simple. Hate the ideas, attack the ideas, respect the person.

 Also, be open minded enough to understand that you yourself might be wrong about some things.&quot;]]></wp:comment_content>

&quot;Moderate&quot; Muslim Leaders preaching hate in Britain.

Seems to me your missing the point here.  These people want un-believers to convert or die (and Jews to just die).  I don't think they are offended...their methodical.

I'm not saying all muslims are evil.  I am saying that this &quot;problem&quot; ain't 100 guys in a cave.  Its mainstream and its much larger then our domestic hate mongers the white and black supremisists combined and as such the solution needs to match the threat.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Nope. Not kidding.

The point is that in a democracy, in a free society, no one has the right to not be offended.

That's simply saying that everyone has the right to free speech. Take, for example, the cartoons a few years back. Certain portions of the world population tried to make a point that the cartoonists &lt;strong&gt;did not have the &lt;i&gt;right&lt;/i&gt; to offend them&lt;/strong&gt;. They believe that their sensibilities are more important then the cartoonist's rights of free speech.

This is totally against free societies basic precepts.

&quot;No one has the right to not be offended&quot;

I am not missing the point. I acknowledge that there are some crackpots out there. I &lt;strong&gt;refuse&lt;/strong&gt; to paint all muslims with the same brush that the crackpots are painted with.

Doing that only makes the problem worse. It creates a 'us vs them' mentality on both sides. We will not be able to change Muslim religion. We need the moderates in the culture to stand up and put the crackpots into place.

That is all that I have ever said.

That, and the Muslims do not have a corner on the world market of religious based insanity. We simply have to look to Europe's history (not to mention the history of the US) to see that Christians are just as capable of justifying horrendous acts in the name of God.

I honestly believe that it has something to do with the belief in absolute truth. But that's another story, for another day.

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Humans are a contentious warlike species.  We wage war.  Religious people wage war, non-religious people wage war.  Monotheists wage war.  Pantheists wage war.  Atheists wage war.  The common element doesn't seem to me to be belief in any given creed, the common element seems to be that humans are a warlike bunch.

Many religions try to limit this tendency.  Obviously they have limited success, but I think it hard to justify the concept that there would not be war if it was not for religion.

To talk about the specific problem right now, I think saying that it is only a few Muslims who believe their religion justifies, and perhaps even requires, violence is a mistake.  While it may not be an absolute majority of Muslims that think this way, it is certainly a very signifigant minority.  Ignoring that fact is engaging in wishful thinking.

Of course one can believe, as I do, that this violence is not inherent within Islam.  If it is, then yes genocide is effectively the only answer.  At the same time though, it is quite clear that Islam can be used to justify this violence, and it is equally clear that this is in fact occuring.   At nearly every place where Muslims come into conflict with the other, whether we are talking geographic boundaries such as the Sudan, Israel, Thialand or Serbia or culteral boundaries such as Londan, Paris and Brussels, we are seeing violence with Muslims being one of the parties involved.

This says to me that their is a problem, and pretending it doesn't exist won't solve it.

I am not sure how to solve this problem, but I suspect that pointing it out, and trying to get those Muslims who disagree with this violent philosophy to engage the problem within their religion is the best way forward.]]></wp:comment_content>

That's what I said. Heh - we agree on something, Dave. :)

Honestly, I do believe that the New Testament is a pretty good look at the history of the era. However, to use a book which was written by committee and salespeople as an unquestioning basis for a life, well, that does not make sense to me. Same with the Koran. I do not know as much about it's history and the lineage of the translations as I do about the bible, however it seems to me anything written over 500 years ago, not to mention thousands, where we do not have the verifiable original writings of the original author are suspect, and should be taken with a grain of salt.

There was an episode of &lt;a href=&quot;http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8152208608191358213&quot;&gt;Bullshit&lt;/a&gt; by Penn and Teller that covered the bible. I recall a portion of it where they were talking about two different written authorities on Elvis who disagreed with the King's fried chicken recipe. If we cannot get it right after 30 or 40 years, what happens after 500 or 2500?

My only point is that to take the bible as the 'literal, unchanging word of God' is a little misguided. We know that the bible has changed over the years, and we have the original documents to prove it. This does not mean that Christians are misguided, but rather that Christians should question their holy book, and make sure that it's at least internally constant.

I have gotten a lot of flack for stating these (in my mind) obvious things. I still stand by them. We were born with the ability to question, to examine and to make our own choices. If in fact God Did create us, then not using these gifts of his seems to me to be counter productive. There is a lot of the Bible and the Koran which makes for interesting reading. However, I would not want a literal reading of either to be used as the basis for the laws of any land which I lived in.

To solve our recent problems with the Mid East and the extremist Christians in the West, I think that we need to engage their more moderate brethren in dialog. Open our minds to the fact that not all are as extreme and fanatical as the ones who fight against us. Convince the moderates to stand up to the radicals, and publicly chastise them. If enough of the community speaks out, then we will be left with a war which is winnable. One that is about money and power, no longer hidden behind a facade of religious propaganda.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Amazing Tsykoduk, is it just me or this conversation about Islam always returns to Christians?  Do you have some pent up anger at Christians or something?

Hey, the Constitution is a 200+ years old and no one can agree on what it means so I guess it all must be false and we are all mislead?  And Penn and Teller are of course the authoritative source on truth...as well as MTV.

At any rate back to the Topic.  As I pointed out to you before (though briefly) why it is the moderates will not &quot;regulate their own&quot; is because they are still Muslim.  The Koran says God forbids them to interfere.

Sura 9:38, 39, 41, 44, 45 &quot;9:38-39,41,44-45 O ye who believe! what is the matter with you, that, when ye are asked to go forth in the cause of God, ye cling heavily to the earth? Do ye prefer the life of this world to the Hereafter? But little is the comfort of this life, as compared with the Hereafter. Unless ye go forth, He will punish you with a grievous penalty, and put others in your place; but Him ye would not harm in the least. For God hath power over all things. ... Go ye forth, (whether equipped) lightly or heavily, and strive and struggle, with your goods and your persons, in the cause of God. That is best for you, if ye (but) knew. ... Those who believe in God and the Last Day ask thee for no exemption from fighting with their goods and persons. And God knoweth well those who do their duty. Only those ask thee for exemption who believe not in God and the Last Day, and whose hearts are in doubt, so that they are tossed in their doubts to and fro.&quot;

Sura 48:17 &quot;No blame is there on the blind, nor is there blame on the lame, nor on one ill (if he joins not the war): But he that obeys God and his Apostle,- (God) will admit him to Gardens beneath which rivers flow; and he who turns back, (God) will punish him with a grievous Penalty&quot;

In other words, Allah will punish any Muslim that opposes another Muslim from making war on non-believers.  The Islamofascist declared war on America since the early 70's and we are still waiting for the moderates to check their own and it ain't going to happen, especially with the radicals in our country right now.

I think right now we are on a path to lose because we don't even know who we are fighting as a country.  Very few Americans fully understand what the threat is.  Heck the Democrats had an Imam lead their prayer for their winter meeting who is a Hezbollah supporter who thinks Americans and Jews should die and in his prayer he states &quot;So guide us to the right path. The path of the people you bless, not the path of the people you doom&quot; and no one...even the talking heads in the news...stopped to ask what does he mean by the right path and the people God &quot;dooms&quot;.  The right path is obviously Islam and the people who are doomed are everyone else...pretty much everyone attending the DNC winter meeting except maybe Elison if he attended.  So the Democrats in the eagerness for tolerance all bowed their heads and prayed for their own destruction or conversion.

To quote Lincoln (paraphrased) &quot;America will never be destroyed from the outside. If we falter and lose our freedoms, it will be because we destroyed ourselves.&quot;]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;Hey, the Constitution is a 200+ years old and no one can agree on what it means so I guess it all must be false and we are all mislead?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Um. No. We have the original of the Constitution. We can look at the authentic original of the document and read what actually was written. With most older religious texts, the originals are long, long lost. What we are reading are copies of copies of copies. And, these are not Xerox copies, they were copied by hand, by people with their own opinions and paradigms.

And that's not even adding in the translations the document had to go through.

So, we cannot authenticate that what is written down now is truly what was written down then. If you look into the historical documents that the Koran and Bible (as well as the Buddhist works) are based upon, you can find some very major differences between them. At some point, the scribe doing the copying had to make a choice between the two. And, not having access to the originals, he simply chose what he &lt;b&gt;though&lt;/b&gt; was the best, or what would get &lt;strong&gt;his&lt;/strong&gt; point across the best.

&lt;blockquote&gt;In other words, Allah will punish any Muslim that opposes another Muslim from making war on non-believers. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The problem here is this statement: 'In other words'. Some one else might read that passage totally differently. It's all about how you interpret the words. To place universal significance on something that is not laid out in black and white, something which has been copied by hand and translated for hundreds, if not thousands, of years.. Well that just seems silly to me.

&lt;blockquote&gt;I think right now we are on a path to lose because we don't even know who we are fighting as a country. Very few Americans fully understand what the threat is.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

So, what is the answer? How do we fight this war for hearts and minds? I have heard you saying &quot;we are not doing the right thing, we are not doing enough&quot;, but what would the &lt;em&gt;right thing&lt;/em&gt; be? How do we proceed?

It seems to me, if we espouse rhetoric which states 'All Muslims are against us, and even if they are not actively trying to kill us, they will not lift a finger to stop it' will certainly do one thing. It will make all Muslims believe that &lt;strong&gt;we&lt;/strong&gt; are against &lt;strong&gt;them&lt;/strong&gt;. It will engender a feeling of mistrust towards us, and convince more and more of them to join the ranks of the radicals.]]></wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In an application I am writing, we gather three items about a person's Name: Their Username and  their First and last names.</p>


	<p>In different parts of the application we want to have their names displayed in different ways. For Example, we want to have the opening page say Hi, First Name!. We want log entries to display their Username in one field, and their Last Name comma First Name in another field. We want to have their First Initial comma Last Name in another area.</p>


	<p>In this application, we store names as attributes in an attributes table, rather then in the person table. I talked about <a href="https://greg.nokes.name/2007/1/3/cross-model-attributes">Cross Model Attributes</a> a while ago.</p>


	<p>We assume the following:</p>


<ul>
<li>Person is the model for people</li>
<li>Person.name is the username</li>
<li>Attrib is the model for attributes</li>
<li>Attrib.name holds the name of the Attribute</li>
<li>Attrib.value holds the value</li>
<li>We have polymorphic associations set up</li>
</ul>

	<p>To accommodate all of these different display needs, I wrote this little snippet of code:</p>


<table class="CodeRay"><tr>
  <td class="line_numbers" title="click to toggle" onclick="with (this.firstChild.style) { display = (display == '') ? 'none' : '' }"><pre>1<tt>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yet Another New Theme.</p>


	<p>Just switched to the slick <a href="http://www.benlog.org/projects/reddish">Reddish</a> theme. I think that I have decided that I am going to try and stay away from creating themes for the time being. I am having much more fun doing back end stuff anyways. So, I will use other's themes, and tweak them to my vision of perfection....</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Decided yesterday to head on over to Seattle for the weekend. So, I am in Lakeview (just south of Seattle for all of you poor folks who do not live in the Pacific Northwest), posting from a freinds livingroom.</p>


	<p>I <b>was</b> going to work on building a site for a new convention that is coming to spokane in the next year or so. You can see how much work I got done <a href="http://nokes.kicks-ass.net">here</a>.</p>


	<p>LoL.</p>


	<p>Anyways, I will be using Mephisto as the front end for the application. I will also be building a registration system and a game scheduler.</p>


	<p>Should be fun.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.badastronomy.com/bablog/2007/02/27/pale-blue-dot/">The BA</a> brought this video to my attention. Fantastic stuff.</p>


<object width="425" height="350">
    <param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/47EBLD-ISyc"></param>

	<p>I really believe that we are on the cusp of a transcendence. Not really in a metaphysical way, but in a social way. People have been talking about it for a long time, because they could <em>feel</em> what was coming. Many have tried to wrap their religion or metaphysics around it. It's simpler then that.</p>


	<p>I think that we are going to see a move away from the old superstitions which hold us back. As we discover more and more about the universe, how it works, and our place it in, it becomes evident that we <b>are not</b> the center of <b>anything</b>.</p>


	<p>We, however do have a great impact on the world which we live on. If we plan on living here much longer, we need to take steps, hard steps, to insure that the world will support us. We are not here to 'dominate' the world, we are here as guests of the world.</p>


	<p>It's far past time to realize that simple fact. We are not the reason that the world is here, the world is the reason that we are here. Once we shift our thinking away from dominance towards partnership, we will be in a lot better place socially, environmentally, and economically.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<guid isPermaLink="false">30/2008/12/27/on-global-warming</guid>
<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over on another site, there is an intresting discussion raging about <a href="http://www.nwgamers.org/ForumsPro/viewtopic/t=1284.html">Global Warming</a>. Just thought that I would cross post my first response over here.</p>


	<p>-</p>


	<p>Let's just stick to facts:</p>


<blockquote>Over the last century the average temperature has climbed about 1 degree Fahrenheit (0.6 of a degree Celsius) around the world.</blockquote> (<a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/12/1206_041206_global_warming.html">National Geographic</a>.)

	<p>That's from 2004. A lot has happened since then.</p>


	<p>So, now we have proven, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that global warming exists, is happening, is real.</p>


	<p>The debate seems to be over two other points - 1) Do we have a global effect? and 2) What is it going to cause?</p>


	<p>Let's start with the last one... and go to the most extreme real world example we have.</p>


	<p>Look at Venus. That is the classic example of runaway global warming - and some think that is where we are headed. Are we? Who knows. I don't. However it is <strong>possible</strong> that we could end up with a Venus on our hands.</p>


	<p>If you look at the <strong>theory</strong> about the gasses trapped in the permafrost, add in some basic albedo calculations, factoring the loss of ice (highly reflective to heat), the Earth just might become a pressure cooker.</p>


	<p>Will it? There is a chance. What is that chance? I dunno. Should we try and do something to stop it? I believe that we should. Should the government do it? That is an entire other question, but suffice it to say, since they are taking our taxes, I would rather see that money spend on alternative fuels/energy research then some of the other silly pork barrel projects that are running amok.</p>


	<p>Current theories believe that Venus might have been earth like at one time, however due to several factors, dumped all of it's Carbon and <span class="caps">H20</span> into it's atmosphere in a horrific version of global warming.</p>


	<p>So, with that in mind, do we contribute to the effects? Yes, with out a doubt we do.</p>


<blockquote>World carbon dioxide emissions continue to increase steadily in the <span class="caps">IEO2006</span> reference case, from 25.0 billion metric tons in 2003 to 33.7 billion metric tons in 2015 and 43.7 billion metric tons in 2030. Carbon dioxide is one of the most prevalent greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and anthropogenic (human-caused) emissions of carbon dioxide result primarily from the combustion of fossil fuels for energy.</blockquote>
(<a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/ieo/highlights.html"><span class="caps">US DOE</span> report, International Energy Outlook 2006</a>)

	<p>I ask one simple question: How can 20 - 30 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide not have some effect?</p>


	<p>Take, for example Volcanos...</p>


<blockquote>On the Big Island, we have a significant natural source of greenhouse gas. Kilauea volcano emits more than 700,000 tons of <span class="caps">CO2</span> each year, less than 0.01% of the yearly global contribution by human sources</blockquote>
(<a href="http://hvo.wr.usgs.gov/volcanowatch/1998/98_10_22.html">US Geological Survey</a>)

	<p>And, that's in 1998. Almost 10 years later, the anthropogenic emissions have steadily risen. Do we have an effect? You bet.</p>


	<p>Is all of this correct? Possibly: that's why they are called theories and not laws. A theory is a working set of assumptions on how something works. When a theory breaks because of new evidence or what ever, you either change the theory or discard it and start anew. That's what science is, folks. Science is not about faith - it's about proof and skepticism. It is grounded in empirical reality.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[There are a few other 'facts' that you are missing though.

One is, when looking into space we can look not just at Venus, but at Mars, which is currently experiencing a warming trend as well, with polar ice reductions.  Unless we think that Pathfinder is the cause of this, it is unlikely to be anthropogenic.

Another fact is that the Earth's climate has been variable throughout history.  It has been both warmer and cooler then it is now.

While I would agree that 'without a doubt' we have an effect on the Earth's, I think that their is a great deal of doubt as to how much of an effect we have and what precisely all of those effects are and how they inter-relate.  Butterfly's 'without a doubt' have effects on hurricane's, but that doesn't mean that they cause them, or that killing all the butterflys would end the hurricanes.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[True...

&lt;blockquote&gt;There are three competing theories here.

1) Global Warming is going to destroy the earth tomorrow.
2) Global Warming will have some effect, what we do not know
3) Humans cannot effect the earth. We are too puny.

From a risk analysis perspective, it would be prudent to assume that the truth is between 1 and 2, and take some actions.

After all, if it is true - and we assume that it's not, we are screwed. If it's not true, and we assume that it is, we get cleaner vehicles and no dependency on oil.

Unless you make your money from Oil, that seems pretty cut and dry to me.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I don't entirely disagree with that, however I will point out that fossil fuels are very concentrated and very cheap energy.  Perhaps we can develop something that will compete, but from what I can tell we don't have anything that is the equal of fossil fuels yet.  In the meantime, cheap energy is directly related to increased quality of life and their are very real costs, costs that are born disproportiately by the poorest amoung us, of making energy more expensive.

Making a rational, realistic balance is more complex then what you present, and while we could theoretically abandon all use of fossil fuels tomorrow, it would almost certainly result in more suffering then the global warming would.

And of course, the single biggest anthropomorphic warming effect is probably methane from livestock rather then CO2 from cars anyway.  That gets ignored probably because it doesn't 'fit' well with the anti-technology religion that many advocates of extreme measures to deal with global warming embrace.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;I ask one simple question: How can 20 , 30 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide not have some effect?&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Well, try thinking of it in these terms. 30 billion metric mm of water wouldn't have that big an effect on the ocean. The atmosphere is MASSIVE, going nearly 70 miles up into space and covering the entire planet (unlike the seas which only go about a mile or so down - deeper in parts but not much). The atmosphere is of course less dense than the ocean, but it's just an analogy.

And I'd rather instead of the Government trying to fix something they have no control over simply give me back my taxes since they're doing a piss poor job of managing the cash themselves.

Seriously, if there is ANY way to make a cheaper energy source that was profitable it will get done on it's own. Until then, we can pass all the laws we want but nobody is going to give up their lifestyle (especially the Goracle!), they're going to force you to give up yours.

Besides, if GW continues (and I seriously doubt it will) the Earth simply gets warmer and we evolve. If we don't evolve correctly, we die off. That's the course of nature in which we are totally a slave to.,]]></wp:comment_content>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>Identity theft accounted for 255,000, or 37 percent, of more than 686,683 complaints registered with the <span class="caps">FTC</span> in 2005. These figures mark the sixth year in a row where identity theft has topped the list of complaints filed with this agency. The most commonly reported form of identity theft was credit card fraud, followed by phone or utilities fraud, and bank (electronic funds transfer) and employment fraud.
<br /><br />
You can reduce your risks for identity theft, but you don't have control over government agencies, hospitals, or retail stores that manage to lose your personal information. The following list will walk you through the steps that will help you recover your identity and restore your credit rating.</blockquote>

	<p>The <a href="http://www.yourcreditadvisor.com/blog/2007/03/your_identity_h.html">story</a> goes on to explain the 21 steps to take when you're identity has been stolen. Good reading, good to know.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>Except that I'm left with the uneasy feeling that I've been ever-so-elegantly mugged. Presumably there's no connection between your recent sales downgrade and what you might call the negative goodwill generated for customers like me.</blockquote>

	<p>Good read. I used to be of the mind that high security meant a lack of usability, however, that is not always the case. In any matter, the reverse it certainly not true. Vista seems to be a big 'FU' from Microsoft to the users who complained about the lack of security.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Working with a core group of my friends, I have decided to put together an exploratory committee to look into forming a campaign for President in 2008. We have had several meetings laying the groundwork for this effort. We are excited to announce that we have already secured several large backers who believe that my presidency would bring solutions to most of the worlds problems.</p>


	<p>Our first full scale meeting is tonight, so expect an exciting announcement tomorrow.</p>]]></content:encoded>

For example, I had to come up with a method of saving all of a users 'important' documents off of their desktop computer in preparation for a wipe and re-image. Not only that, but it's a good idea. So I wrote 'scan and copy'</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today my local congresscritter emailed me a quick survey.</p>


<blockquote>Q. What is the best way to help lower gas prices and reduce our nation's dependence on foreign oil?<br />
<ul>
<li>Invest in alternative energy sources such as solar, wind and hydropower</li>
<li>Increase domestic supply by drilling in <span class="caps">ANWR</span> and the Outer Continental Shelf</li>
<li>Promote conservation</li>
<li>Invest in biofuel</li>
<li>Prohibit price gouging</li>
<li>Other</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

	<p>So, of course I chose 'other'.</p>


	<p>heh</p>


<blockquote>
  Yes. All of these approaches are needed. We must invest in the future, while still meeting today's demands.

  Looking forward, a petrochemical based economy is simply unsustainable. If it's peak oil, or Global Climate Change, or Mideast instability, it is irresponsible to assume that we can continue on the same path that we have been. Bio-fuels and Solar power would be a boon for Eastern Washington, as we have extensive agribusiness. Solar and Wind power both are interesting long term solutions to a growing energy market.

	<p>However, these technologies are neither cheap nor quick to implement. In the short term, using the technologies that we have at hand, we must find a way to drastically reduce our reliance on others to feed our growing energy appetite. Conservation is already happening. Market forces have realised that conserving energy saves them money. With a small nudge in the right direction, conservation could cut our total energy input needs dramatically.</p>


	<p>Just look at the difference between a Volkswagen Jetta v6 and <span class="caps">TDI</span>'s economy. The <span class="caps">TDI</span> gets better real world fuel economy then a hybrid. We must look at technologies that can help us in the short term, while still readying us for the long term.</p>


	<p>Couple a reduced domestic demand with an increase in local petrochemical production, and we have a winning short term tactic. Drilling <span class="caps">ANWR</span> is not a pleasing though to me, however, if it would allow us to detach from the politically unsavory deals that we must make to feel the American need to drive, then so be it.</p>


	<p>I do not believe that there is any one thing that we can do which will solve our energy problems. It's going to take a multi-pronged approach to resolve this issue. It's going to take a bi-partisan group, partnering with business and local concerns.</blockquote></p>


	<p>Peace. Out.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A co-worker pointed out that <a href="https://greg.nokes.name/2007/4/3/scan-and-copy">Scan and Copy</a> did not work all that well on XP. Not a real issue, since I had used it to back up win2k machines in prep for a XP roll out. Well, anyways, I made the few changes to XP it, as well as adding in some more functionality.</p>

            <!--more-->

            <p>There are now 3 command line options</p>


<ul>
  <li><b>-name</b> Names the target directory, which will be created if it does not exist</li>
  <li><b>-target</b> Gives a target directory to place the backup folder in.</li>
  <li> A list of file extensions to look for</li>
</ul>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://greg.nokes.name/assets/2007/7/23/iphone.png" width=200 style="float: right;" />
Well, today was day one with my new techno-lust-gadget. It's fit and finish is what you would expect from Apple. The device feels good in the hand, and fits as a phone, unlike some of the blackberrys that I have used. I must say that I am very impressed over all with the device.</p>


	<p>Here are my day one notes.</p>


<ul>
<li> Battery life is acceptable. I have been using it very heavily today, and I have used less then half the battery. By my estimation, I should get 8 hours of heavy use w/o a recharge.</li>
<li> The browser is wonderful. I was able to pull up a page and drill down to a photo on the page before my corporate network could get the page loaded. The buttons are intuitive and easy to use, and the look and feel is fantastic</li>
<li> Activation was a snap. Under 10 min for 2 phones.</li>
<li> It plugged right into my Kilpsh iPod speakers, and worked out of the box. The only issue was that it wanted to be in airplane mode due to interference with the speakers when a call was received.</li>
<li>Typing on the keyboard (or lack thereof) was a concern. I have poor typing skills, and big fingers. However, it seems to work as well as or better then a normal keyboard</li>
<li> The Calendar is just freaking cool. I do however, really want to see tasks added in.</li>
<li> I was frugal (cheep) and only sprung for the 4 gig model. My top played list fits just fine however, and I am going to use that money to get the Apple headset</li>
</ul>

	<p>More later...</p>]]></content:encoded>

<blockquote>The only thing that saves us from the bureaucracy is inefficiency.
An efficient bureaucracy is the greatest threat to liberty.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Being in politics is like being a football coach. You have to be smart enough to understand the game, and dumb enough to think it's important.</blockquote>

<blockquote>One thing about a pig, he thinks he's warm if his nose is warm. I saw a bunch of pigs one time that had frozen together in a rosette, each one's nose tucked under the rump of the one in front. We have a lot of pigs in politics.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The two-party system has given this country the war of Lyndon Johnson, the Watergate of Nixon, and the incompetence of Carter. Saying we should keep the two-party system simply because it is working is like saying the Titanic voyage was a success because a few people survived on life-rafts.</blockquote>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After the success of the transformers movie, it looks like a really good Giant Robot franchise is coming back.</p>


<blockquote>Spider-Man star Tobey Maguire will produce and may star in a film based on the classic SF anime Robotech, according to The Hollywood Reporter.

	<p>Warner Brothers Pictures picked up the rights to Robotech, which features giant robots known as mechas. Maguire is producing through his Maguire Entertainment banner and is eyeing the lead role in what the studio plans as an SF franchise a la Paramount's hit Transformers.</p>


	<p>Drew Crevello also is producing through his Supercool Hollywood BigTime Productions. Craig Zahler has been tapped to write the screenplay.</p>


	<p>Robotech was a cartoon series during the 1980s from Harmony Gold <span class="caps">USA</span> and Tatsunoko Productions. It was re-edited and re-dialogued to combine three Japanese anime series to give the producers enough episodes to air as a daily syndicated series.</p>


	<p>Robotech takes place at a time when Earth has developed giant robots from the technology on an alien spacecraft that crashed on a South Pacific isle. Mankind is forced to use the technology to fend off three successive waves of alien invasions. The first invasion concerns a battle with a race of giant warriors who seek to retrieve their flagship's energy source, known as "protoculture," and the planet's survival ends up in the hands of two young pilots</blockquote></p>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, I was tasked to create a authentication system for one of the apps that I wrote a while back at work. I had written the application in Ruby on Rails, and we use Microsoft's Active Directory for network authentication. Taking pity on the users of my application, I decided to do some research and see if I could bump my authentication vs the <span class="caps">AD LDAP</span> server. This is what I came up with...</p>

            <!--more-->

            <p>First things first - we need to add the secret sauce to the model which will allow use to connect to a <span class="caps">LDAP</span> server. We want to add the following function to the model that handles your users. We also need to add a <code>require 'ldap'</code> to the model, before the class definition. You also want to define <code>AD_DOMAIN_NAME</code> to be what ever the domain that your users will be logging into.</p>


<table class="CodeRay"><tr>
  <td class="line_numbers" title="click to toggle" onclick="with (this.firstChild.style) { display = (display == '') ? 'none' : '' }"><pre>1<tt>

</tt>    <span class="r">end</span><tt>
</tt>  <tt>
</tt>  <span class="r">end</span></pre></td>
</tr></table>


	<p>I also added the following to allow me to create the basic user skeleton with out the validations running on it.</p>


<table class="CodeRay"><tr>
  <td class="line_numbers" title="click to toggle" onclick="with (this.firstChild.style) { display = (display == '') ? 'none' : '' }"><pre>1<tt>
</tt>2<tt>
</tt>3<tt>
</tt></pre></td>
  <td class="code"><pre ondblclick="with (this.style) { overflow = (overflow == 'auto' || overflow == '') ? 'visible' : 'auto' }">  <span class="r">def</span> <span class="fu">build</span><tt>
</tt>      <span class="pc">self</span>.save(<span class="pc">false</span>)<tt>
</tt>  <span class="r">end</span></pre></td>
</tr></table>


	<p>I did not want the users passwords to be recorded in the log files, so we need to add this to the application controller</p>


<table class="CodeRay"><tr>
  <td class="line_numbers" title="click to toggle" onclick="with (this.firstChild.style) { display = (display == '') ? 'none' : '' }"><pre><tt>
</tt></pre></td>
  <td class="code"><pre ondblclick="with (this.style) { overflow = (overflow == 'auto' || overflow == '') ? 'visible' : 'auto' }">   filter_parameter_logging <span class="sy">:password</span></pre></td>
</tr></table>


	<p>Now, we need to add some code to the controller which controls your users and their authentication. I use the following</p>


<table class="CodeRay"><tr>
  <td class="line_numbers" title="click to toggle" onclick="with (this.firstChild.style) { display = (display == '') ? 'none' : '' }"><pre>1<tt>

</tr></table>


	<p>What does this mess do? Let's look at it.</p>


	<p>First we assume that we have a form already hooked up to this function. When we call this, we assume that we have been passed 2 values, <code>userid</code> and <code>password</code>. We assume that we have defined <code>LDAP_SERVER = "your_server"</code> some where else in the controller.</p>


	<p>So, first things, we pass the user name and password to the model and attempt to authenticate. We check to assure that none of the fields are blank. The line <code>if password.nil? || password == "" || login.nil? || login == ""</code> takes care of this, and we pass a <code>false</code> value back to the calling function if any of it is true.</p>


	<p>Next, we need to set up the connection to the <span class="caps">LDAP</span> server <code>conn = LDAP::Conn.new(host, 389)</code> and <code>conn.set_option(LDAP::LDAP_OPT_PROTOCOL_VERSION, 3 )</code>  takes care of this. Assuming that everything works, we now have a good connection to the <span class="caps">LDAP</span> server. You can test this assumption with <code>conn.bound?</code> (for example, from the console).</p>


	<p>We need to pass the user name and password to the connection and see if we get a positive result from the resultant credentials check. <code>fulllogin = AD_DOMAIN_NAME + login</code> formats the ad domain name and user name correctly, and then <code>conn.bind(fulllogin, password)</code> sends the credentials off to the <span class="caps">LDAP</span> server. It will pause, and then return the <span class="caps">LDAP</span> object.</p>


	<p>This is all well and good, but did we log in? <code>if conn.err == 0</code> checks the error code returned when we tried to authenticate. If we have anything other then 0, we had problems, so we toss a false back up to the calling function. If we get a 0 back, then we toss a <code>true</code> back up to calling function and press on.</p>


	<p>Let's assume that we get a true back in the controller. So, the user has provided AD a good user name and password. We might have some information that we want to cache locally in the application for performance reasons. For example, I cache the users email address, first name and last name. I made a design choice to keep my applications interaction with AD as little as possible, so I do not pull that information from it.</p>


	<p>If the controller can find a user record with the same user name as the user name which was provided, we press on. If not, we pop the user over to their 'My Account' page and force them to fill out a form which captures the data that we need.</p>


	<p>We then save that data to the local database. Auto populating the database with information from AD is left to the gentle reader.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I cut my teeth on NetWare 3.1x servers oh so many years ago. So this announcement is bitter-sweet</p>


<blockquote>Novell's long journey from NetWare to Linux is finally complete. On Oct. 8, Novell released Open Enterprise Server 2 to its customers worldwide. Shortly after acquiring <span class="caps">SUSE</span> and its enterprise-focused Linux distribution, Novell announced that its follow-on to NetWare 6.5 would ship as a set of network services that could run atop the NetWare and the Linux kernel, <span class="caps">OES 1</span>.0. <span class="caps">OES</span>, which began shipping in April 2005, was the first major step in Novell moving NetWare's services from its native operating system to Linux. Now, with <span class="caps">OES 2</span>.0, the NetWare operating system kernel, NetWare 6.5 <span class="caps">SP7</span>, is still there if you run it, but it runs on top of the Xen hypervisor. You can also run the NetWare services, or a para-virtualized instance of NetWare, on top of Xen with the <span class="caps">SLES 10 SP 1</span> kernel. So, if you're wedded to NetWare and its way of doing things, you don't have to wave good-bye to it.</blockquote>

	<p>-<a href="http://www.osnews.com/story.php/18746/Good-Bye-NetWare-Hello-Linux-Novell-Open-Enterprise-2.0/">OSNews</a></p>


	<p>I have felt that NetWare needed a fork stuck in it for quite a few years now. I moved away from using it day to day about 4 or 5 years ago. Don't get me wrong, I administer 10 or 12 NetWare 6.5 servers, however I can count on one hand the number of times I have had to do anything with them this year, other the change users passwords and reload the backup program.</p>


	<p>I guess that was one of the nice things about NetWare. It just ran. It was the best file and print server at the time, bar none. However, now I would prefer to run a <span class="caps">CUPS</span> server and Netatalk/Samba for my print and file services. Really, the only thing that I miss is the file system rights and <span class="caps">IRF</span>'s. Their rights system was clean, easy, and very very powerful. Not a combination that one sees often.</p>]]></content:encoded>

	<p>I am starting a new F/OSS project as basically the lead developer (until we get some one better). I had about 2 or 3 hours of work into it, found this article, and decided to scrap all of the work and build with rails 2.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>But Mr. Gibson withdrew whenever the discussions grew heated. And by not intervening more forcefully early on in the Republican debate, he allowed much of their discussion to remain staid and uninformative â€” <b>Representative Ron Paul, of all candidates, dominated the foreign policy debate.</b></blockquote>

	<p>-<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/06/us/politics/06watch.html?_r=1&#38;oref=slogin">NYTimes: He Came, and He Saw, but Did He Moderate?</a></p>


	<p>The other Republican candidates seem out of touch with reality. Rudy Giuliani actually said that the past US Foreign policy had nothing to do with the 9/11 attacks. True, they were carried out by people with a choice; however our foreign policy in the region never has been one that thought of the people in the region. Rather we have sought outcomes which serve our interests, at the detriment of the people. And we wonder why the people of the Middle East dislike the United States. We have used these people for years as pawns in our grand game of world domination. And, now the bill for our misbehavior is coming due.</p>

            <!--more-->

            <p>This philosophy of a 'Just War' that has been bandied about for the last few years is deeply flawed. Any unprovoked aggressive action is not just. Bullets and Bombs do not spread democracy , they spread hate. Think about it this way. If Iran were to bomb us, invade us, occupy us and tell us that we had to install a Islamic government, how would we react?</p>


	<p>And yet, the warmongers in Washington keep bombing, invading and occupying other countries, and expecting them to suddenly become a 'democratic' country.  Or, we get an election, and if the people elected are not the ones we want, we take actions which harm the people on the street.</p>


	<p>A perfect example of this flawed policy is Palestine. They had a free and fair election. They elected the party that they believed in. We pulled all aid (which has been propping up their economy for decades). Their country crumbled; there were riots, civilian deaths, and street warfare. How is this fair? How does this engender the person on the street to the US?</p>


	<p>We simply have to stop interfering in the internal affairs of other countries. We need to stop propping up governments that are expedient to our short term aims, and start to truly spread freedom by example. We need to become world leaders again, instead of bullies.</p>


<blockquote> Whether the United States was trying to keep the shah of Iran in power or trying to prevent the rise of Arab nationalism and nonalignment, its policy was a blunt instrument applied presumptuously to subtle and complicated problems. One journalist has likened it to playing pool with a 20-foot cue stick. It would have been a miracle had the result not been chronic turmoil. The impracticality of the policy would have been a stumbling block even if the United States had not been on the side of injustice.</blockquote>

	<p>It's time to back away from brinkmanship and interventionist policy. It's clear that it has not worked , the last 50 years of history have show that beyond that a shadow of a doubt.  If we are to shake the image of a bully, and regain our good standing in the world, we must become a force for positivism rather then negativism.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[&quot;Any unprovoked aggressive action is not just.&quot;

I doubt that anyone would disagree with that.  The question is, in defining 'unprovoked.'  As an example, if I see some being mugged, is it unprovoked if I intervene since I am not the person being mugged?  Some say so, at least in how it applies to foreign policy.

I think that it is part of the duty of the strong to defend the weak.  Certainly, we can't be everything to everyone, but that doesn't mean we can't be anything to anyone.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[If you see some one mugging another person - do you stop the mugging, or do you shoot them? Do you shoot them, or attack their home, killing their family?

Several of the Republicans in the ABC/Facebook debate said that they supported preemptive action. By definition, a preemptive attack is unprovoked. We might &lt;b&gt;think&lt;/b&gt; that something is going to happen, but - do you shoot people because you think that they are going to murder someone (to quote Dr. Paul)?]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[First off, I note that you accept my premise that defending another can be just provocation.

Of course proportionality is always an issue in just war.  One always tries to use the minimum violence to accomplish ones objective.  Obviously though the scale of the mugger and say, genocide, are different and require different levels of force.  Just as a large man confronting an unarmed mugger might simply be able to use his physical strength, while a small woman facing a mugger with a knife would probably need to at least threaten to shoot and possibly follow through on that threat.  Of course the deliberate targetting of non-combatants is always wrong.

Secondly, there is confusion between two terms:  pre-emptive war and prevantative war.

Preemptive war deals with the threat of an immediate attack.  The classic example of this is the 1967 Six Day war.  Very few people are oppossed to preemptive war other then complete pacifists.  And of course we advocate shooting people who we think are going to murder someone all the time.  For example, shooting a person who is holding a gun to a hostages head is generally considered by most to be justified, even though we can't be certain that the gunman will pull the trigger.

Preventative war is a much more difficult question.  Rather then responding to an immediate tacticle situation, it is designed to prevent a future unfavorable strategic condition.  Of course one of the reasons for the Iraq War was preventative (not preemptive.)  Similarly the Israeli attack on Osirak was a preventative strike and Gen. Patton wanted to attack Russia at the close of WWII to prevent a future war with that nation.

Clearly the judgements that must be made in choosing a preventative war are more complex, and less certain then either a preemptive war or a war in response to an attack.  Certainly the certainty will be less, so one must expect the stakes to be higher.  Most people, in hindsight, support the Israeli strike on Osirak.  The Iraq war is much more controversial (although I would argue not so much for reasons of justification.)  However, one can conclude that preventative war is sometimes proper without necessarily agreeing that it is proper in a particular circumstance.

Of course this is a harder thing to do, and those that like simplicity are often unwilling to deal with this sort of hard question.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Defending another &lt;b&gt;can&lt;/b&gt; an excuse to get involved as it were. There is certainly a gray area about level of force which can be applied - and it really depends on the circumstances. I would suppose that we should apply the 'golden rule' to it - if circumstances were reversed, how would we like to be treated?

In re the 'Just War' concept - I had heard it used to justify the War in Iraq. I have a pretty big problem with War being used to 'solve' anything. War should be viewed as a failure. Certainly there are times that it is correct to use force - however those circumstances are far and few between. Changing a sovereign countries style of government is not an appropriate use of force - military, economic or otherwise.

The West (and America especially) has a long history of interventionist policies in the Middle East. We are now seeing what these policies bring about, and the crow does not taste good. We cannot undo what we have sown since the 20's, however we can start to put the pieces back together.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Asking how I would wish to be treated if I were a genocidal dictator doesn't seem to provide any real wisdom.  I should imagine that I would want to given lavish gifts and have no one interfere with my power over my people.  But I imagine that our mugger in the above analogy would prefer that no one defend his victim as well.

Just War theory was of course used to justify the war in Iraq, others used it to claim that the war in Irad didn't meet the requirements of a just war.  It seems to me that you haven't really read up on what just war theory is, what variations there are to it, and how people think that it should be used.  It is certainly something worthy of study, even if you decide that the basic tenets are not sound (although I suspect you will not, you will just disagree with some people as to how a particular set of circumstances relates to the theory.)

I don't personally believe in sovreign nations.  That is an outdated concept.  I believe in the sovreignty of people, and that governments are only legitimate if they reflect that sovreignty.  That is though a seperate issue then just war, although it could have implications.

I also don't think it possible for us to not intervene in the Middle East.  Things that happen there matter here, and things that happen here matter there even more.  Isolation is an impossibilty given our place in the world.

That doesn't mean of course that any particular intervention is a good idea.  What to do, and what not to do can be a comples question as well, but once again it is a question that must be answered with sober thought and a good deal of faith, not avoided because it is hard.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;Asking how I would wish to be treated if I were a genocidal dictator doesn't seem to provide any real wisdom.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Asking how, as a people, you would like to be treated does. Why do so many of the radical, evil ideas spread in that area? I would posit that is is in part because of the foreign policy choices this country has made since the 1920's.

Let's take Pakistan. How would you - a citizen of Pakistan - feel knowing that the US has given billions of dollars to your dictator?

Let's hit closer to home. What if China were to give several billion dollars to some president that you do not like - say - Edwards or Ron Paul? What if another country were interfering in our country? Would you become endeared to that country? Or, would that create resentment, anger etc?

What if the US Government felt that it was necessary to find you an ugly, ill-tempered wife, and make you marry them? Send police in to 'keep the peace' by suppressing your rights?

This is such an obvious linkage - we interfere, we prop up bad people, we get hated. It's not rocket science, and any attempt to whitewash our past in the area simply makes it worse.

&lt;blockquote&gt;But I imagine that our mugger in the above analogy would prefer that no one defend his victim as well.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Of course. However, if he were going to be stopped, do you think that he would prefer to be

a) tazed into unconsciousness
b) shot in the leg
c) beat into a bloody pulp
or
d) restrained, and taken in to custody?

If I were to be that mugger, I would certainly prefer option d. There are sick people out there, and other circumstances that might arise, however I am simply saying - let's start with the one that we would prefer if the roles were reversed and see what happens. Let's not start by shooting.

Now think about another country doing this for almost a century.

How can an interventionist policy like what we have seen help?

&lt;blockquote&gt;It seems to me that you haven't really read up on what just war theory is,&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I have.  I do not agree that any war is 'just'. I feel that some are inventible, and that is a sad state of affairs. That is something that we need to work on as a world. WWII - a perfect example of a war that did not have to happen. It was not in our control, so it was inventible, but still not just, nor right. It was a dark time for the entire world.

&lt;blockquote&gt;That doesn't mean of course that any particular intervention is a good idea. What to do, and what not to do can be a comples question as well, but once again it is a question that must be answered with sober thought and a good deal of faith, not avoided because it is hard.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I would add - with strong international support. I do not espouse hiding under our blankets - but rather getting out of the nation building business. Get the mindset that we know better then the rest of the world, and that we have some higher right to dictate to them how to live. We do not have any such authority.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;Let's take Pakistan. How would you - a citizen of Pakistan - feel knowing that the US has given billions of dollars to your dictator?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I've said many times that Pakistan is a tough call.  But lets look at another dictator we stopped supporting, the Shah of Iran.  If I was an Iranian, I would rather live under the Shah (although he was certainly not perfect) then the Mullahs.

I certainly think we need to try and work to build stronger Democratic institutions in Pakistan.  Clearly, Musharafah is an unreliable partner in that, but that doesn't mean that just abandoning the situation and hoping that good will come out of it is the responsible course.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Let's hit closer to home. What if China were to give several billion dollars to some president that you do not like - say - Edwards or Ron Paul? What if another country were interfering in our country? Would you become endeared to that country? Or, would that create resentment, anger etc?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

What about Lech Wallesa and the Polish solidarity movement?  We helped to support that, along with many others, and the Polish people are greatful for that.  Throwing away the purpose and the starting situation and saying it is all the same just isn't sensible.  I do believe that we should support democracy everywhere, although I acknowledge that the exact steps to do so may not be equal.  We should not interfere with a nations internal politics when those politics are based upon the legitimate will of the people, and as I believe that ours are, China should not interfere with ours.  Should we be mad at the French because they helped to support the American Revolution?  Of course not.

Lets take another exampe, if I was a Jew in Nazi Germany or a Tutsi in Rwanda, would I be satisfied that even though the world was ignoring genocide  it was ok because they were not 'interfering' with my nation?  Obviously not.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Let's not start by shooting.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sure.  That how we always start.  Many violent criminals do in fact resist arrest.  They fight back.  If we had a magic wand that would remove oppressive dictators without any violence I'd certainly wave the hell out it.  We don't have that wand.

We have to make choices between standing back and allowing violence or becoming violent ourselves to stop violent men.  There isn't a solution without violence in it.

&lt;blockquote&gt;WWII - a perfect example of a war that did not have to happen. It was not in our control, so it was inventible, but still not just, nor right. It was a dark time for the entire world.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Of course it was in our control, well not WWII but our involvement in it was.  We could have surrendered to Japan after Pearl Harbor.  We could have made it clear before then that we wouldn't do anything to oppose Japan and Germany's ambitions as long as they didn't enter our territory.  Saying we didn't have choices is stupit.

Now, no one is claiming that Japan and Germany's wars were just (at least no one that I know.)  Just War is pretty much explicity not just for both sides, if Side A is justified, then Side B is not and vice versa.

If you believe that we should not have surrendered after Japan and Germany declared war upon is then you do indeed believe in just war.  You might have a pretty high bar for when war is justified though.

&lt;blockquote&gt;I would add - with strong international support.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Why?  Your previous contention has been that the main reason we should avoid interfering is because it makes us 'hated' but probably the two biggest causes of that hatred, the establishment of Israel and the first Iraq war and resulting sanctions, both had strong international support.  International support doesn't seem to be any defense against this hatred, and equally international support, in the case of the two above examples, doesn't seem to lead to any perfect or even better solution.

I'm not saying that I oppose having international support, but it doesn't seem to square with your other points.

&lt;blockquote&gt;I do not espouse hiding under our blankets - but rather getting out of the nation building business. Get the mindset that we know better&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If we aren't going to build nations, what are we going to try and do?  Simply support the status quo?  Try and weaken nations?  If we are going to be involved, we should be involved with a purpose, and that purpose should I think be to build, to advance freedom and prosperity around the globe both because it is the right thing to do and it is in our own self-interest to do so.  Obviously the tools for that cause are varied, and certainly the military is a tool only for extreme situations, but nation building is indeed what we should be trying to do.

As to believing we know better, we have to act on what be believe is correct.  How else should be act?  We should do what we don't think is right?]]></wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>"I have opponents in this race who do not want to change the Constitution," Huckabee told a Michigan audience on Monday. "But I believe it's a lot easier to change the Constitution than it would be to change the word of the living god. And that's what we need to do -  to amend the Constitution so it's in God's standards rather than try to change God's standards so it lines up with some contemporary view."</blockquote>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I am certainly no fan of Huckabee, and I disagree with how he would apply this statement, but I don't necessarily disagree with the concept itself.

I think any believer in a moral code would desire that their government not conflict with that code.  Clearly, if one is a believer in God (or Buhdism for that manner) in any meaningful sense the tenets of the belief system would take prededence over the secular government, and if they were oppossed action would be justified to change that.

Where Huckabee gets it wrong though, I think, is in his interpretation of what the moral code he professes to believe in actaully says.  Many Christians, and Huckabee certainly seems to be one of them, seem to think that Christianity contains some sort of demand that Christians confess and punish the sins of others.  I can find no justification for this belief.

I suspect that a lot of the confusion arises from a similarity between many sins and many crimes.  Murder being an easy example, it is both a sin and a crime.  However, sin and crime are not the same thing just because some things are both any more then green and rock are the same because jade is a green rock.

Sin is concerned primarily with spiritual damage, especially damage to oneself.  This is especially true in Christian theology, where the sacrifice of Christ is held to 'pay' for all sin.

Crime on the other hand is primarily concerned with damage to society, most particularly of one member of society to another.

It would of course be sinful to not attempt to contribute to the building of a better society, but a better society is one that (among other things) deals properly with crime but doesn't concern itself with sin.

There is of course some overlap.  One would expect spiritual (call is psychological if you prefer) damage to have an effect on society and possibly damage it as well,  but a competing virtue is free will so a balance must be struck between the two extemes.  One can make arguements for and against issues such as gay marriage within this spectrum, but that is where I believe a proper Christian would leave it.  (in the case of gay marriage I am convinced that the arguments favor it.)]]></wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In an ever misguided attempt to reorginize this blog, I decided that I had far too many sections. I wanted to use tags more, and sections less. But that left me with the following question - how to move the articles around? Should I do it by hand? Na....</p>

            <!--more-->

            <p>So, the first task to tackle was to make sure that the existing section structure was migrated over to tags.</p>


	<p>I cobbled together this little hunk of code</p>


<table class="CodeRay"><tr>
  <td class="line_numbers" title="click to toggle" onclick="with (this.firstChild.style) { display = (display == '') ? 'none' : '' }"><pre>1<tt>
</tt>2<tt>
</tt>3<tt>
</tt>4<tt>
</tt><strong>5</strong><tt>
</tt>6<tt>
</tt>7<tt>
</tt>8<tt>
</tt></pre></td>
  <td class="code"><pre ondblclick="with (this.style) { overflow = (overflow == 'auto' || overflow == '') ? 'visible' : 'auto' }">sections = <span class="co">Sections</span>.find(<span class="sy">:all</span>)<tt>
</tt><span class="r">for</span> sect <span class="r">in</span> sections<tt>
</tt>  arts = sect.articles<tt>
</tt>  <span class="r">for</span> art <span class="r">in</span> arts<tt>
</tt>    art.tag = sect.name<tt>
</tt>    art.save<tt>
</tt>  <span class="r">end</span><tt>
</tt><span class="r">end</span></pre></td>
</tr></table>


	<p>This will parse all of the articles in the database, and add a tag for each section that they belong to.</p>


	<p>Second was how to move the articles around...</p>


<table class="CodeRay"><tr>
  <td class="line_numbers" title="click to toggle" onclick="with (this.firstChild.style) { display = (display == '') ? 'none' : '' }"><pre>1<tt>
</tt>2<tt>
</tt>3<tt>
</tt>4<tt>
</tt><strong>5</strong><tt>
</tt>6<tt>
</tt>7<tt>
</tt>8<tt>
</tt>9<tt>
</tt><strong>10</strong><tt>
</tt>11<tt>
</tt>12<tt>
</tt></pre></td>
  <td class="code"><pre ondblclick="with (this.style) { overflow = (overflow == 'auto' || overflow == '') ? 'visible' : 'auto' }">sect = <span class="co">Section</span>.find_by_name(<span class="s"><span class="dl">&quot;</span><span class="k">old_section_name</span><span class="dl">&quot;</span></span>)<tt>
</tt>new_sect = <span class="co">Section</span>.find_by_name(<span class="s"><span class="dl">&quot;</span><span class="k">new_section_name</span><span class="dl">&quot;</span></span>)<tt>
</tt>arts = sect.articles<tt>
</tt><span class="r">for</span> art <span class="r">in</span> arts<tt>
</tt>  <span class="r">if</span> art.sections.include? new_sect<tt>
</tt>    art.sections.delete sect<tt>
</tt>  <span class="r">else</span><tt>
</tt>    art.sections &lt;&lt; new_sect<tt>
</tt>    art.sections.delete sect<tt>
</tt>  <span class="r">end</span><tt>
</tt>  art.save<tt>
</tt><span class="r">end</span></pre></td>
</tr></table>


	<p>Since it's not really an automatable choice, I plugged the correct values in for <code>old_section_name</code> and <code>new_section_name</code> and  allowed it to move stuff where I wanted it. Viola, 20 sections down to 4.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>The builders of the world’s biggest particle collider are being sued in federal court over fears that the experiment might create globe-gobbling black holes or never-before-seen strains of matter that would destroy the planet.</blockquote>
This is serious. Globe Gobbling Black Holes? Destruction of the Planet? Stop the Presses!

(from <a href="http://cosmiclog.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2008/03/27/823924.aspx">MSNBC</a>)
<blockquote>The Large Hadron Collider, or LHC, is due for startup later this year at CERN’s headquarters on the French-Swiss border. It’s expected to tackle some of the deepest questions in science: Is the foundation of modern physics right or wrong? What existed during the very first moment of the universe’s existence? Why do some particles have mass while others don’t? What is the nature of dark matter? Are there extra dimensions of space out there that we haven’t yet detected?</blockquote>
Ok, so we have Big Science being done… but where are the black holes?
<blockquote>Former nuclear safety officer Walter Wagner has been raising such questions for years - first about an earlier-generation “big bang machine” known as the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider, and more recently about the LHC.

Last Friday, Wagner and another critic of the LHC’s safety measures, Luis Sancho, filed a lawsuit in Hawaii’s U.S. District Court. The suit calls on the U.S. Department of Energy, Fermilab, the National Science Foundation and CERN to ease up on their LHC preparations for several months while the collider’s safety was reassessed.</blockquote>
Ahhh… I start to see the light.

Silly people, science is Good! Honestly, (as the article discusses) the interaction between Cosmic Rays and the upper atmosphere is higher energy then this little dinky thing. After all, I seem to recall (but cannot find a citiation for) there was a fear that the first Fusion Bomb would cause a chain reaction and blow up the world’s oceans.

Some level of prudent care must be taken, but I doubt that these scientists <strong>want</strong> to blow up or implode the planet.

Here’s to the LHC providing us with lots of years of cool stuff to come!]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://greg.nokes.name/assets/2008/3/28/rosette_abtps_thumbnail.png" style="float:right;" /><i>In doing some spring cleaning, I found this old article from years past. Enjoy!</i></p>


	<p>If you work in networking, you probably want to be notified when something crashes, looses connection or just generally goes T.U.</p>


	<p>Enter, Condor NG! Condor NG is a simple shell script used by yours truly to monitor my work network. It's light, easy and just plain works.</p>

            <!--more-->

            <p>There are only two config file, the Site file (site.cfg) and the Mail file (mail.cfg). site.cfg should have a list of host names to check, one per line. As many as you want. mail.cfg should have the email addresses that you want to send this to, one per line.</p>


	<p>The rest assumes that we are installed into /belfry with a /belfry/tmp and /belfry/log - change as needed. You can change that under defines in the script. If you want it to email you (or text your cell phone thru the email interface - check with your provider for details if you do not know how) you will need to set the mailgate define to the host name of your mail gateway. If not, set mailgate to localhost, so it will not think that the entire world has crashed.</p>


	<p>Use cron to schedule (I run it every five minutes)</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://greg.nokes.name/assets/2008/4/14/the-shadow-knows.png" alt="The Shadow Knows" style="float:right;">This morning I read an interesting <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/08/04/14/16FE-guerrilla-it_1.html">article</a> at Infoworld. It deals with the collision of paradigms between old IT and the new Infoworkers.</p>

<blockquote>Here's a sobering statistic: Eighty percent of enterprise IT functions are being duplicated by folks outside of the IT department, says Hank Marquis, director of ITSM (IT systems management) consulting at Enterprise Management Associates. In other words, for every 10 people doing IT work as part of their jobs, you've got another eight "shadow IT" staffers doing it on their own. </blockquote>

            <!--more-->

            <blockquote>You probably know them. They're the ones who installed their own Wi-Fi network in the break room and distribute homemade number-crunching apps to their coworkers on e-mail. They're hacking their iPhones right now to work with your company's mail servers. In short, they're walking, talking IT governance nightmares. </blockquote>

<p>-<a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/08/04/14/16FE-guerrilla-it_1.html">Infoworld</a> </p>

<p>I would amend this - they are old IT's worst nightmare. As the article points out, they can become an organizational asset.</p>

<blockquote>The reason superusers go rogue is usually frustration, says Marquis. "It's a symptom of the IT organization being unable to meet or even understand the needs of its customers," he says. "Otherwise, it wouldn't be happening." </blockquote>

<p>-<a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/08/04/14/16FE-guerrilla-it_1.html">Infoworld</a> </p>

<p>One of the things that IT sometimes forgets in their rush to security is that IT is a tool for business. It should be an enabler, not a hindrance. Too often, old IT implements rules and regulations which stifle creativity and solutions, with out an understanding of the real world problems that the business is facing. They mean well, however they do not understand the reality of life in the trenches.</p>

<p>There is a fine line between rules and regulations which enable a safe environment, and rules which are a hindrance and circumvented simply to get the job done.  A perfect example is a company that I once worked with. They had a rule about thumb drives (only a specific model, only with encryption turned on, etc). There was no way of using the drive with out being an admin on the workstation - as drivers need to be installed and loaded each time the device was inserted.</p>

<p>So, no one used thumb drives. They used CD-RW's instead. Every machine had a CD-RW drive in it (as all modern machines do) and the software loaded. It was more of a headache, but they could still move large files around. Users are smart. They tend to find ways around policies and rules if they need to.</p>

<blockquote>Procedures are a tough balancing act. If they're too lax, there will be security problems. If they're too tight, people will get around them and there will be security problems.</blockquote>

<p>-<a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2008/04/people_and_secu.html">Bruce Schneier</a></p>

<p>One of the solutions that I have used in the past, and the Infoworld article talks about is bringing the 'superusers' into the fold. Make them part of IT in some fashion or other. The article has several good examples, and I have actually used a few in the past. But here is the skinny, IMHO...</p>

<p>Superusers can be a great ally. Policies are no use if they are not used. If the superusers understands why a policy is in place, and how to still use their tools in an effective manner, they can be a powerful public opinion tool. After all, if the superusers are grousing about this or that, they will bring down the collective opinion of the IT department.</p>

<blockquote>"My goal is to have 100 percent of our knowledge workers be shadow IT," says Weider. "Every employee must be tech-savvy and leverage the tools provided in order for us to have any hope of achieving a return on our very expensive IT investments." </blockquote>

<p>-<a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/08/04/14/16FE-guerrilla-it_1.html">Infoworld</a> </p>

<p>It all comes down to ROI. Organizations that have users which, via polices and training, are enabled to leverage technology will see a higher ROI. They will  become agile and more entrepreneurial. They will foster creative and relevant solutions, and survive in the global marketplace.</p>

<p>The way I see it, an IT 'group' is an outmoded way of thinking. IT should become a decentralized, organic part of the company. As the MySpace generation enters the workforce, I think that we are going to see more and more of this. And it's a good thing.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Agreed. The problem that the old way of doing things has, is that it tends to be so restrictive that users become annoyed.

Things like multiple systems, all with separate access credentials, and then changing the passwords constantly, may sound like a great security feature. In reality, this does nothing more then force users to start writing down their passwords (a big security no, no) because the IT world has increased their security requirements to the point of stupidity.

As with most things, the level of access need only be as complex and secure as the item they are protecting.

Allow your users to create secure passwords (I really like the trend in systems showing the password complexity when it's created) and then let them use those secure passwords for longer. Unless a users feels as though their password has been compromised, there is no need to constantly be changing them.

Don't get me started about retarded thumb drive rulesâ€¦ It seems as though with every new technology comes a new level of ignorance to control it.

One of the huge keys to successful system security is user training, and ongoing user training, not just a quick 10 minute session when they first get hired. Train your users over and over again until it is second nature to do the right thing with IT systems. No, it's not perfect, but not training your users is a real bad practice.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[On the thumb drives, I can see training, and limiting them. There was a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.darkreading.com/document.asp?doc_id=95556&amp;WT.svl=column1_1&quot;&gt;hack&lt;/a&gt; involving 'free' thumb drives with a picture and an embedded Trojan horse on board. So, that threat is at least real. A good reaction would have been to find solution that worked, across computers, with out drivers or applications. Or simply educated users about the dangers of Thumbdrives, and made sure that it was against policy to have any sensitive data on them.]]></wp:comment_content>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://greg.nokes.name/assets/2008/4/20/images-1_thumbnail.png" alt="nSync" style="float:left;">One of the challenges where I work is keeping a near line copy of large amounts of data. Tape is to slow to restore off of, and can be a hassle since we have off site tape storage requirements. Thus SyncScript was born. It's a windows only, quick and dirty little ruby app to move about large amounts of data using a rather brute force method...
<br />
<br /></p>

            <!--more-->

            <p>Did I mention that it's windows only?</p>


	<p>You will need to have either Ruby installed or use the spiffy <a href="http://www.erikveen.dds.nl/allinoneruby/index.html">AllInOneRuby</a> script to build yourself a ruby.exe.</p>


	<p>Well, let's go ahead and jump right in and look at the config.rb</p>


<table class="CodeRay"><tr>
  <td class="line_numbers" title="click to toggle" onclick="with (this.firstChild.style) { display = (display == '') ? 'none' : '' }"><pre>1<tt>
</tt>2<tt>
</tt>3<tt>
</tt>4<tt>
</tt><strong>5</strong><tt>
</tt>6<tt>
</tt>7<tt>
</tt>8<tt>
</tt>9<tt>
</tt><strong>10</strong><tt>
</tt>11<tt>
</tt>12<tt>
</tt>13<tt>
</tt>14<tt>
</tt><strong>15</strong><tt>
</tt>16<tt>
</tt></pre></td>
  <td class="code"><pre ondblclick="with (this.style) { overflow = (overflow == 'auto' || overflow == '') ? 'visible' : 'auto' }"><span class="c">#SyncScript Config</span><tt>
</tt><span class="c">#</span><tt>
</tt><span class="c"># Standard ruby lang here</span><tt>
</tt><span class="c"># so you can do things like</span><tt>
</tt><span class="c"># if date == Friday then ....</span><tt>
</tt><tt>
</tt><span class="c">#List backup sources here as UNC paths,</span><tt>
</tt><span class="c">#ie \\\\myserver\\myshare</span><tt>
</tt><tt>
</tt><span class="iv">@job_name</span> = <span class="s"><span class="dl">&quot;</span><span class="k">Daily Backup</span><span class="dl">&quot;</span></span><tt>
</tt><tt>
</tt><span class="iv">@sources</span> = [<tt>
</tt>  <span class="s"><span class="dl">&quot;</span><span class="ch">\\</span><span class="ch">\\</span><span class="k">someserver</span><span class="ch">\\</span><span class="k">someshare</span><span class="dl">&quot;</span></span>,<tt>
</tt>  <span class="s"><span class="dl">&quot;</span><span class="ch">\\</span><span class="ch">\\</span><span class="k">someotherserver</span><span class="ch">\\</span><span class="k">someothershare</span><span class="dl">&quot;</span></span> <span class="c">#,</span><tt>
</tt><tt>
</tt>]<tt>
</tt></pre></td>
</tr></table>


	<p>You will want to give the job some pithy name, and a few sources.</p>


<table class="CodeRay"><tr>
  <td class="line_numbers" title="click to toggle" onclick="with (this.firstChild.style) { display = (display == '') ? 'none' : '' }"><pre>1<tt>
</tt>2<tt>
</tt>3<tt>
</tt>4<tt>
</tt><strong>5</strong><tt>
</tt>6<tt>
</tt>7<tt>
</tt>8<tt>
</tt>9<tt>
</tt><strong>10</strong><tt>
</tt>11<tt>
</tt></pre></td>
  <td class="code"><pre ondblclick="with (this.style) { overflow = (overflow == 'auto' || overflow == '') ? 'visible' : 'auto' }"><tt>
</tt><span class="c"># Where do we want to store the backup?</span><tt>
</tt><span class="c">#Do not use a trailing slash - bad things will happen</span><tt>
</tt><tt>
</tt><tt>
</tt><tt>
</tt><span class="r">if</span> <span class="co">Time</span>.now.day.to_i % <span class="i">2</span> != <span class="i">0</span><tt>
</tt>  <span class="iv">@target</span> = <span class="s"><span class="dl">&quot;</span><span class="k">c:</span><span class="ch">\\</span><span class="k">backups</span><span class="ch">\\</span><span class="k">day</span><span class="dl">&quot;</span></span><tt>
</tt><span class="r">else</span><tt>
</tt>  <span class="iv">@target</span> =  <span class="s"><span class="dl">&quot;</span><span class="k">e:</span><span class="ch">\\</span><span class="k">backups</span><span class="ch">\\</span><span class="k">day</span><span class="dl">&quot;</span></span><tt>
</tt><span class="r">end</span><tt>
</tt></pre></td>
</tr></table>


	<p>Here we are showing off some of the strength of the config file. Since it's simply a ruby file, we can use whatever ruby idioms we want - in this case, we have 2 hard drives in the target machine (c: and e:) and we want to split the backups between them for redundancy's sake. We could have simply mirrored them, but this way we get the full capacity and we still get some backup... the most we will loose is 1 day if a hard drive fails. Since this is a near line enhancement to an existing tape based system, that risk was deemed acceptable.</p>

</tt><span class="iv">@rotate</span> = <span class="i">2</span><tt>

	<p>Pretty basic stuff here. The job types work - however full is the only one tested in a production environment - <span class="caps">YMMV</span>. The rotate # is the number of old backups you want to keep.</p>

	<p>Yes, we can do pre-runs to clean up, or set stuff up for the backup (mapping a target drive, shutting down the AV system...)</p>


<table class="CodeRay"><tr>

	<p>The crc32 is from when I was coding this as a linux app. However, that was shunted - and we use xcopy's validate function now.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So - from January 1st till yesterday, you were working for the government. Today on, according to the <a href="http://www.taxfoundation.org/">Tax Foundation's</a> <a href="http://www.taxfoundation.org/publications/show/93.html">report</a>, you get to keep what you make. As a comparison, you had to work 114 days to pay for the Government, and only 108 for Housing, Clothes and Food.</p>


	<p>Seem excessive?</p>


<blockquote>If we run into such debts, as that we must be taxed in our meat and in our drink, in our necessaries and our comforts, in our labors and our amusements, for our callings and our creeds, as the people of England are, our people, like them, must come to labor sixteen hours in the twenty-four, give the earnings of fifteen of these to the government for their debts and daily expenses; and the sixteenth being insufficient to afford us bread, we must live, as they now do, on oatmeal and potatoes; have no time to think, no means of calling the mismanagers to account; but be glad to obtain subsistence by hiring ourselves to rivet their chains on the necks of our fellow-sufferers.</blockquote>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, today was my last day on the government contract. I decided to move on, and pursue a fantastic opportunity which came along. Leaving was really hard. I had worked at the same office for 5 years, and for the same agency in Spokane for 8 years. I have a lot of friends there, but it was time to move on.</p>


	<p>I will be posting more about what I am going to be doing in the next few weeks, so stay tuned!</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I just found <a href="http://www.secondrotation.com/">this site</a>. Really cool concept. Read it, use it, rinse and repeat. I have a feeling that ol' Lappy is going to them soon. Shela will be getting a newer laptop soon (she wants an Air) and I need an iMac to go with my new Macbook.</p>


	<p>Anyways... good stuff. I will report back after Lappy is sent off to the wild blue.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, I got to go hang out with all of the folks at RailsConf in portland this year. Way cool, lots of fun!</p>


	<p>Highlights:</p>


	<p>"If you think I am lying, just punch me!" <del>- <span class="caps">WACK</span> -</del> OW! (the great stripper brawl of 2008)</p>


	<p>"Is that Bacon on that maple bar??" (asks a New Yorker)</p>


	<p>"apparently we should use our surplus to build giant demonic penises. i mean, towers. yeah." (Via Twitter when <span class="caps">DHH</span>'s keynote shows a slide of Dubai)</p>


	<p>"You mean we have been following directions from someone who's nickname was Mr Magoo? <span class="caps">WTF</span>??" (after 23 hour trek thru downtown portland looking for a bar... any bar...)</p>


	<p>Yeah - so bad <a href="http://gallery.mac.com/tsykoduk#100008&#38;view=mosaic&#38;sel=0&#38;bgcolor=dkgrey">pictures</a> have been posted, sleep has been obtained, and the trip is over.</p>]]></content:encoded>

I don't know if I am going to care and keep the old posts and comments yet. That is in the "to be determined' category.</p>


	<p>What has been determined is that this place needs a major revamp. So, a revamping I go, a revamping I go...</p>


	<p>Yeah...</p>

Add one last post in this blog that points to your new blog.  Then keep your old blog up - forever.  Though, that means you'd need a new URL or hostname for your new blog...

Either way, I'm a big fan of history.  And by blogging, you are contributing to that history.

Let it live, one way or the other...]]></wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I really have not had the time to work on anything productive except work type stuff for the last 4 or 5 months. It's amazing - when I worked at my old job, I was bored to tears - now I do not have enough time to even think - and I love it!</p>


	<p>I have been doing a lot of thinking in regards to the upcoming election. I was sad, but not surprised when Ron Paul did not make it. He at least brought some actual conservative ideas to the debate. As I expected, the Republican Party dismissed him out of hand, and dismissed the ideas that he proposed as "silly".</p>


	<p>Well, neo-cons - look where your ideas have gotten us over the last 8 years. It is time for a change in Washington. So,  McCain does not have my vote. He seems to bring a reckless nature to the game which we really don't need. So far Obama has not done anything to dissuade me from voting for him (and no, spurious reports from Fox News do not count).</p>


	<p>Obama's views on taxation concern me. I do agree that lowering taxes and spending more (as the current administration has done) seems to be a wee bit counterproductive. I disagree that more regulation will solve all of our woes.</p>


	<p>We'll see how the next 40 days run. I just might be writing in Ron Paul.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You know,  I hate these "tag you're it" memes. But here goes - for the <a href="http://katielejoi.blogspot.com/2008/11/seven-things.html">Cuz</a> I have not seen in years factor.</p>

            <!--more-->

            <p><img src="https://greg.nokes.name/assets/2008/11/26/tall_man.jpg" style="float:right;"> 1) I am tall and old. My MySpace profile points out that I am 8'11" and 99 years old. Here is a picture of me when I was a teenager at the Worlds Fair in Saint Louis. I was on the team of crack icecreamologists who developed the waffle cone. Since I was also part of the defense contractor team who invented plastic, I actually wanted to make a wiffle cone. Taste tests, however showed that the waffle cone was far superior. So I relented on that one. However, I was able to drastically improve the plastic content of Spam.</p>


	<p>2) The Ghost Bat (Macroderma gigas), also known as the False Vampire Bat is a bat endemic to Australia, named for the extremely thin membrane of its wings that makes it appear ghostly at night. Ghost Bats have grey fur on their backs and pale grey or white fur on their undersides. They have long, narrow wings but no tail, averaging 11 cm in length. Females are generally smaller than males. The adaptations of the ghost bats: They have large ears for long distance hearing, and very sharp teeth so they can attack prey.</p>


	<p>3) I stole that from the wikipedia article on Ghost Bats. Seriously. You can see it right at the top of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_Bat">page</a>. I googled two random words, and picked a random link that came up. Well, in all probability it was not really random, as I tend to gravitate towards wikipedia for reasons unknown. It's like a glue that causes me to stick to it. Or perhaps it has lots of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gecko#Gecko_toes:_setae_and_van_der_Waals_forces">little hairs</a> on it's feet.</p>


	<p>4) I honestly believe that everything can be explained using a combination of Google and Wikipedia. Except for that one burning question. Why do we really need <a href="http://uncyclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/Nihilism">hair</a>?</p>


	<p><img src="https://greg.nokes.name/assets/2008/4/23/anonymous.gif" style="float:left; padding:10px;">
5) I often tell the truth.</p>


	<p>6) I like pictures.</p>


	<p>7) Who is this guy?  I mean, really, honestly, truthfully, who is he? Is it a he? or a she? or a they? a we? I have a Wii. I do like it.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<title>Filesystem scaling in high traffic web applications</title>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the more interesting problems that high traffic, high load web applications face is how to scale the filesystem. As load increases, vertical scaling (bigger servers) simply does not work. You have to add more application servers, and more layers to effectively serve the needs of the users. One of the issues that many such applications have to overcome is how to serve assets (pictures, podcasts, video) to all of the edge servers that a user might access the application from, and allow users to upload user generated content.</p>

            <!--more-->

            <h3>What is Filesystem Sharding?</h3>


	<p>As disk IO based applications grow, they tend to run into limits of IO speed, file system size and stability. This trend is especially relevant in clustered web applications using a cluster aware filesystem such as <span class="caps">GFS</span>, NFS or Lustre FS. However it effects all applications which use disk to store assets at some point.</p>


	<p>There are several low level tactics which can mitigate this issue in the short term, such as using high performance <span class="caps">RAID</span> arrays, and various tuning parameters in the Operating System hosting the application. Ultimately, these measures will fail to meet demand. At that point, filesystem sharding needs to be investigated.</p>


	<p>This discussion is predicated upon the use of Linux as the host operating system. There are similar tools and concerns in the Windows environment, however they are different enough to warrant own treatment.</p>


	<h3>Tactics</h3>


	<p>There are two basic levels of filesystem sharding, basic file system sharding and application filesystem independence. Basic sharding will take an application to a certain point, and after that application level sharding needs to be implemented. Often, the authors have seen that basic sharding will allow an application to continue to grow while filesystem independence is implemented.</p>


	<p>At a high level, basic sharding is accomplished by inserting an algorithm into the save and load modules, keying off of a unchangeable feature (such as username, file name, etc). You then share to different physical devices mounted under your main partition. Application level filesystem independence includes rewriting the save and load functions to abstract out the filesystem, allowing the application to use what ever file store it needs, where ever that filesystem resides. This is usually implemented as an agent. The application talks to an agent somewhere requesting assets. This allows you to abstract the file system to another machine or even another data center if needed.</p>


	<h3>Basic Sharding</h3>


	<p>Basic Sharding is accomplished by taking the shared file system, and adding several mount points inside of it. The only application change is a hashing algorithm to determine which file system is used. It can be as easy as inserting a snippet of code into the save and load methods.</p>


	<p>As an aside, one of the limitations of many cluster file systems is performance degradation when there are to many files in one directory. In preparation for sharding the filesystem, it's often beneficial to use this hashing system to break up your filesystem before implementing complete filesystem sharding. One of the advantages is that this positions you for painless movement to the goal. Since Linux mounts filesystems as directories, it is a trivial task to move the existing directories, mount the new filesystems, and then move the data back. If you already have the hashing system in place and tested, this makes the move that much less stressful.</p>


	<pre><code>if user.name is odd
    ... use /data/shard_1
else
    ... use /data/shard_2
end</code></pre>


	<p>Logically the disk layout will be very simple,</p>


	<pre><code>/data
    /shard_1
    /shard_2</code></pre>


	<p>and the physical layout will be similar.</p>


	<pre><code>/dev/sda1 mounts to /
/dev/sdb1 mounts to /data
/dev/sdc1 mounts to /data/shard_1
/dev/sdd1 mounts to /data/shard_2</code></pre>


	<p>The advantages of this over a standard one file system approach are two fold. First, mount times and file system repair/check times are decreased, as the file systems are each smaller. Secondly, file system maintenance can be preformed on the live application with less undesirable side effects then simply taking the entire application off line. One can imagine a error rescue that displays a maintenance page when a users file share is not accessible, thereby allowing some users access to the application while other filesystems are being maintained.</p>


	<p>From a physical layer, this also allows us to do some interesting things like splitting the filesystem to different <span class="caps">RAID</span> arrays. We can even split out the filesystems across different <span class="caps">RAID</span> controllers. We can also start to explore using expensive, fast <span class="caps">RAID</span> arrays only where you actually need them, and use slower, less expensive disk where warranted.</p>


	<p>A more robust version of the sharding algorithm could look like</p>


	<pre><code>case user.name first character
    when = "abcd"
        ... use shard_abcd
    when = "efgh"
    etc...</code></pre>


	<p>It's logical disk layout would be</p>


	<pre><code>/data
    /shard_abcd
    /shard_efgh
    /shard_ijkl
    /shard_mnop
    /shard_qrst
    /shard_uvwx
    /shard_yz</code></pre>


	<p>It's physical layout would be similar to the first example - each shard mount would be on it's own physical device.</p>


	<h3>Application level filesystem independence</h3>


	<p>Application level filesystem independence is an architectural choice, rather then a quick fix. When you reach the point where you are considering this as an option, you have probably already implemented basic sharding. A low level discussion of how to accomplish this is beyond this paper, however we can present some ideas that we have seen work in production sites.</p>


	<p>The most basic implementation of this concept includes injecting logic into the save and load functions which call a module. This module then determines which file server it is going to talk to based on some algorithm. It then opens a socket to an application running on that server, and requests the filesystem operation via the remote application.

This level of abstraction allows us to do some interesting things. Advanced implementations could include ideas like geo-ip tagging, smart synchronization and advanced request forwarding.</p>


	<p>For example, our file system agents can reside on different servers, in different data centers if we wish. We can build a peer to peer synchronization routine into the remote agents, allowing our application to spread load out amongst physical file servers and giving us easy failover and redundancy. In this case, each single asset could be written to several file servers</p>


	<p>We would use geo-ip to redirect the request to a file server closest to the requester. Often we do not want to use this on the client machines, as their location might change. We see this keyed off of application server location.</p>


	<p>Advanced request forwarding allows files not in the local store to be served up. The logic built into this idea should allow an agent to determine if it has a copy of the file in question. If it does not, it should check out a copy from the closest file server which does have a copy. This allows us to start trying and pre-cache items that the requester will need.</p>


All of these are ideas which others have implemented with varying degrees of success.

	<h3>Summary</h3>


	<p>Basic web frameworks can carry a website quite a ways as far as scaling goes. Using clustered filesystems can shoulder the load further. After exhausting the capabilities of vanilla deploys of each of these, you need to look into sharding to carry your application to the next level. Filesystem sharding is a good fit for high disk IO applications.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>I have found that at about 15 - 20 requests per minute per app server, <a href="http://mephistoblog.com/">Mephisto</a> starts to bog down a little. We went from a wall clock of 1 second per page view to about 3. Not to bad.</p>


	<p>With the <span class="caps">VPS I</span> am running on (a <a href="http://engineyard.com">Engine Yard</a> slice) the <span class="caps">CPU</span> was not taxed. I am running <a href="http://code.macournoyer.com/thin/">Thin</a> and each of them grew to a manageable 200 mb of <span class="caps">RAM</span> and hovered there.</p>


	<p>The largest factor was Database hits. Every request touches the database, so putting a simple memcache server into the mix could be a huge win.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I needed to drop <span class="caps">PHP5</span> on a home dev box (running Debian Stable) and since Nginx is all the rage, I wanted to see if I could use that instead of apache.</p>

            <!--more-->

            <p>I found a great <a href="http://jit.nuance9.com/2008/01/serving-php5-with-nginx-on-ubuntu-710.html">article</a> on how to get r done. There were a few gotcha's that I ran into, but honestly, it worked like a charm.</p>


	<p>The largest issue was that the line:</p>


<code>fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME /var/www/nginx-default$fastcgi_script_name</code>

	<p>was truncated to</p>


<code>fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME /var/www/nginx-default$fastcgi_script_</code>

	<p>So I cleaned that up, and ended up with</p>


<code>fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME /var/www/$fastcgi_script_name</code>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As many of you (all one of you?) know, I work from home. Yay me. Well I just reorganized my office, and thought I would share</p>

            <!--more-->

            <p>My primary workspace is a 3 level corner desk. I have Harmon Kardon Sound Sticks as my speakers, a 19's <span class="caps">NEC</span> Opticlear as my primary monitor, an apple aluminum keyboard and a mighty mouse. My primary computer is a white MacBook, and it's monitor is my secondary screen.</p>


	<p>I have an old Dell Intel&#174; Pentium&#174; 4 <span class="caps">CPU 1</span>.60GHz with  645624 kB <span class="caps">RAM</span>, a 20gb <span class="caps">HDD</span> and Linux 2.6.24-etchnhalf.1-686 running on it. I use the digital port for my macbook, and the analog port for the debian box, but 99% of the time I just ssh into it.</p>


	<p>To reduce clutter, I have all of the <span class="caps">USB</span> stuff going through the back of the monitor.</p>


	<p>My network starts with a 7mb <span class="caps">DSL</span> connection downstairs, and an Airport Extreme with an old Express 802.11g for iphone and guest access. Upstairs I have an Express extending the 802.11n network, providing printer sharing for my laser printer and also serving my Sound Sticks via AirTunes.</p>


	<p>Since they are on the same desk as my laptop, why do I use airtunes? Two reasons. First, when ever I would pull the plug to move my laptop I'd get some harsh cracking and feedback. Secondly, it allows me to control the speakers volume from my iTunes dashboard widget and still have my computer alert sounds decoupled from that. When I am on the phone, I tend to turn down my tunes, but I still want to hear the alerts.</p>


	<p>Also, when in bridging mode, the Express offers an ethernet port with access to the wireless. So the old *nix box has 100mb to the wireless via a switch. No need to pull cables. Neat-O!</p>


	<p>Long way of saying, problem solved!</p>]]></content:encoded>

<title>iTunes Backups</title>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now that we are starting to buy / rent movies on our Apple TV, I wanted to have a seamless backup mechanism. The fact that we are running Tiger made it a little more challenging, along with my distain for <span class="caps">COTS</span> software. After all, all I really want to do is keep 2 copies of 1 (rather large) directory else where on the network...</p>

            <!--more-->

            So, I have a 750gb disk on my AirPort Extreme as a backup target for the Leopard laptops in the house. TimeMachine loves to automagically attach and back up all the time. I do not have the luxury of Time Machine on my iTunes server, as it's hosted on an old powerbook running Tiger (lappy for long time readers). Knowing that Mac <span class="caps">OSX</span> has rsync by installed by default, I thought that it should be a trivial task to just rsync the data over to the AirPort.
<code>rsync -r --eahfs --showtogo * /Volumes/backup/itunes/</code>

	<p>Seems to work like a charm! <code>--eahfs</code> tells rsync to maintain the extended <span class="caps">HFS</span> attributes, and <code>--showtogo</code> gives us a progress indicator. (by the way, for all you linux geeks out there, <code>--progress</code> shows progress on my Debian box). <i>Note: we assume that you have mounted the backup volume and created an itunes directory on it</i>.</p>


	<p>Macs have this wonderful directory <code>/etc/periodic</code>. You can guess what it does. I dropped my daily script into the <code>/etc/periodic/daily</code> directory, and the weekly script into <code>/etc/periodic/weekly</code>. Could not be easier.</p>


	<p>The two scripts simply backup to different directories on the backup volume (<code>itunes.wky</code> and <code>itunes.dly</code>). Presto, quick and dirty backups.</p>


	<p>Next week, I add error checking and email reporting to the mix!</p>


	<p><b>Daily code</b></p>


<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
#backup of itunes directory to shared HDD on networky
#daily backup

rsync -r --eahfs /Volumes/monolith/iTunes/* /Volumes/backup/itunes.dly/</code></pre>

	<p><b>Weekly code</b>
<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
# backup of itunes directory to shared HDD on networky
# Weekly backup

rsync -r --eahfs /Volumes/monolith/iTunes/* /Volumes/backup/itunes.wky/</code></pre></p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As usual, <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2006/08/bruce_schneier.html">Bruce Schneier</a> has an interesting look at security, and how banning things like Google Earth might not be such a good idea.</p>

            <!--more-->

            <blockquote>Criminals have used telephones and mobile phones since they were invented. Drug smugglers use airplanes and boats, radios and satellite phones. Bank robbers have long used cars and motorcycles as getaway vehicles, and horses before then. I haven't seen it talked about yet, but the Mumbai terrorists used boats as well. They also wore boots. They ate lunch at restaurants, drank bottled water, and breathed the air.</blockquote>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>I should probably first speak about how adware works. Most adware targets Internet Explorer (IE) users because obviously they're the biggest share of the market. In addition, they tend to be the less-savvy chunk of the market. If you're using IE, then either you don't care or you don't know about all the vulnerabilities that IE has.</blockquote>

<title>Cups vs Avahi vs Mac</title>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have an old HP Laser Jet 6L as my primary printer at home. It's a trooper - I got it new years ago, and I have never had a problem with it. A few years ago, I got an <span class="caps">APC</span> Parallel Port to <span class="caps">USB</span> converter. That works great, until I tried to plug it unto my new Airport Express 802.11n. Woops. Lucky me I have a Linux box right next to the printer..</p>

            <!--more-->

            <p>So the box was running Debian Etch and a Half. I had Netatalk and Avahi running on it with a custom compiled netatalk including <span class="caps">SSL</span> support for <span class="caps">DHX</span> authentication.</p>


	<p>I plugged the printer in, <span class="caps">CUPS</span> saw it, and presto. But when I went to add it to my mac, I could not browse for it. No problem, right? add it to Avahi. No sweat.</p>


	<p>Not so much. Total <span class="caps">PITA</span>. However in my searching, I found this <a href="http://blog.venthur.de/2007/08/17/howto-setup-a-print-server-for-windows-and-others-using-cups-and-zeroconf/">article</a>.</p>


<blockquote><b>First you need to install <span class="caps">CUPS 1</span>.3 or higher</b> on your print server and setup the printer (the web interface makes this task dead easy) </blockquote>

	<p>Ug, Etch is running at <span class="caps">CUPS 1</span>.2.x. With a little research, however I find that <a href="http://www.debian.org/releases/stable/">Debian Lenny</a> has <a href="http://packages.debian.org/lenny/cups"><span class="caps">CUPS 1</span>.3.x</a>. Lenny was also released as stable a few days ago, so it might be a good time to upgrade my server.</p>


	<p>Did I mention how much I love debian?</p>


	<p>So here are the steps to upgrade:</p>


	<p>1) Edit <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code>. Take all of the instanced of <code>etch</code> and replace with <code>lenny</code></p>


	<p>2) Run <code>sudo apt-get install apt dpkg aptitude</code> to upgrade apt and aptitude.</p>


	<p>3) Run <code>aptitude full-upgrade</code>. I ran it three times (until it did not pick up any new packages). You'll need to keep an eye on this, as it will ask you several questions, and some of them are quite important (do you want to revert <code>importantconfigfile.conf</code> to the maintainers version or keep your own?)</p>


	<p>So after all of that, I restarted <span class="caps">CUPS</span> and presto - printer showed up in my Mac's printer browser.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<title>Firefox vs Safari</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[People chide me on my choice of Safari over Firefox on my macs, but here is a reason why….

<!--more-->

So, when I was hacking together the layout for this blog, I noticed something weird. I had a tweet with a really really long “hashtag” in it. Like this:

<img src="https://greg.nokes.name/assets/2009/4/24/Picture_3.png" alt="" />

Obviously, the text ran out side of the sidebar, and looked ugly. <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=css+force+text+width">Google</a> to the rescue. I found some cool <span class="caps">CSS</span> v3 stuff that would fix it.
<pre><code>
        text-wrap: unrestricted;
        word-wrap: break-word;
</code></pre>
Worked like a Charm under Safari. Just like the <span class="caps">CSS</span> v3 docs said it should.

<img src="https://greg.nokes.name/assets/2009/4/24/Picture_4.png" alt="" />

but not so much under Firefox. I was forced to add
<pre>overflow: hidden;</pre>
and get this…

Sigh.]]></content:encoded>

<title>Mephisto Caching with Nginx/Passenger</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now that I had this test bed for new hotness running the new hotness, I decided I should get the caching working again.</p>

            <!--more-->

            <p>Well, this is 2.0 of the code. This seems to work a lot better (like, works in general).</p>


<pre>
server {

  listen  80;
  server_name  some_spiffy_name;
  root /wheremyappis/public;

  access_log /somelogfile.access.log main;
  error_log /someotherlog.error.log notice;
  client_max_body_size  50M;
  passenger_enabled on;

   location /assets/ {
        rewrite ^/assets/(.*)$ /assets/$http_host/$1 break;
   }

   location /cache/ {
        rewrite ^/cache/(.*)$ /cache/$http_host$1 break;
   }

}

</pre>

	<p>And, as an added bonus, it's much easier to read!</p>


	<p>Thanks to mibb in <span class="caps">IRC</span>, we were able to hack the following out:</p>


<pre>server {

  listen  80;
  server_name d;
  access_log ;
  error_log ;

  root ;
  passenger_enabled on;

location /assets/ {
  rewrite ^/assets/(.*)$ /assets/$http_host/$1 break;
}

# this appears to be broken
# / -&gt; index.html
#  if (-f $document_root/cache/$host$uri/index.html) {
#    rewrite (.*) /cache/$host$1/index.html break;
#  }

# /about -&gt; /about.html
  if (-f $document_root/cache/$host$uri.html) {
    rewrite (.*) /cache/$host$1.html break;
  }

# other files
  if (-f $document_root/cache/$host$uri) {
    rewrite (.*) /cache/$host$1 break;
  }

}</pre>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, it's <del>almost</del> over for me, but here are my thoughts about Railsconf 2009...</p>

            <!--more-->

            <p><img src="https://greg.nokes.name/assets/2009/5/7/IMG_0225_2.JPG" style="height: 95px; float: left; padding: 5px;" />I think that this picture (possible <span class="caps">NSFW</span>?) <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/glagla/54320217/">sums it up</a>. We are grownups. the <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=kerfluffle">kerfluffle</a> is over from when Ubuntu "crossed the line" and it will pass for Rails/Ruby as well.</p>


	<p><a href="http://www.engineyard.com/blog/2009/engine-yard-flex-announced-new-features-added-to-solo/">Flex</a> is awesome. The coolest feature - to upgrade an instance to the newest stack, destroy it and recreate it. Heck, create a new one, spin it up, and then destroy the old instance.</p>


	<p>Scaling is pretty simple. Start with solo, grow the instance as large as you need to, and then after you out grown a single instance environment, simply drop and re-add a flex instance. Database gets moved to it's own instance, and presto - you have a horizontally scaleable  cluster in the cloud. Pretty powerful.</p>


	<p>Met some neat people, and I am going to dig into a few new products and see if I need to add them to my tool belt. More on that later.</p>


	<p>I get the feeling that Rails (and ruby) is starting to penetrate the enterprise market space more and more, and I think that's a good thing. It's a powerful tool, and with nginx/passenger or apache/passenger it's pretty easy to run internally if you need to. If you can run it outside, <a href="http://www.engineyard.com/plans/solo/">Solo</a> for low to medium traffic applications is dead simple.</p>


	<p>And, no this is not an advertisement for my <a href="http://www.engineyard.com">employer</a>. I honestly think that Solo/Flex is the easiest deployment option out there. I deployed Rubyflow about 4 or 5 times in 2 hours. I snagged a $30 coupon for <a href="http://heroku.com/">Heroku</a> so I will be giving them a shot in the next week or so, so expect a side by side shootout.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[One of the things I have done for a long time is create what the cool kids today call mixtapes. I used to use a turntable and cassette recorder, now days I use iTunes to burn CD’s for the truck. I usally do one every year or so, and I thought that I’d toss some out there for posterity’s sake.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I love <a href="http://limechat.net/mac/">Limechat</a> for my mac IRC needs. However, it started blowing chunks a few OSX updates ago, and that was plain annoying!

<em><strong>update</strong> <a href="http://limechat.net/mac/">Limechat 1.0</a> fixes the problem. Yay!</em>

I found a really simple fix. Open up markedscroller.rb and comment out line 40. Works like a charm for me.

Simply do <code>sudo mate /Applications/LimeChat.app/Contents/Resources/markedscroller.rb</code> and scroll down to line 40. make the changes below.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[In an article today ("<a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2009/06/cloud_computing.html">Cloud Computing</a>") Bruce Schneier makes some great points about SaaS and Cloud Computing.

<!--more-->
<blockquote>But, hype aside, cloud computing is nothing new . It's the modern version of the timesharing model from the 1960s, which was eventually killed by the rise of the personal computer. It's what Hotmail and Gmail have been doing all these years, and it's social networking sites, remote backup companies, and remote email filtering companies such as MessageLabs. Any IT outsourcing -- network infrastructure, security monitoring, remote hosting -- is a form of cloud computing.</blockquote>
It also breaks the 80/20 rule that I learned back in the old days of BNC connectors. 80 percent of the processing should be local, and 20 percent remote. For some things (the 20 percent) it certainly belongs "in the cloud". However, some things do not belong out there.

I think, however,  that the Bruce misses the point of "the Cloud". From my perspective, it's not about SaaS - it's lower level then that. It's about being able to provision servers in moments in "the Cloud". It brings location independence to bare metal servers. It allows me to create a cluster with a deployed web application, several application servers and a database server in minutes, instead of hours or days. That's the "cloud" that I think of - things like <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a>, <a href="http://www.vmware.com/solutions/cloud-computing/vcloud.html">vCloud</a>, <a href="http://heroku.com/">Heroku</a>and <a href="http://www.engineyard.com">Engine Yard</a>. SaaS can certainly be built on top of this infrastructure.

That is the compelling paradigm behind the Cloud. Being able to elastically provision resources, on demand, almost instantly. Being able to write an application, push a button and having it out there for the world to use. This new paradigm lowers the entry level to becoming a "web business" dramatically.

SaaS and the Cloud are interdependent - the Cloud came to be because of the needs of SaaS and I agree (totally) that SaaS has issues. For example,  I have witnessed an entire office taken off line because the login server was remote. However, to lump SaaS's issues into this new way of looking at servers and capacity is just not getting the big picture.
<blockquote>Trust is a concept as old as humanity, and the solutions are the same as they have always been. Be careful who you trust, be careful what you trust them with, and be careful how much you trust them. Outsourcing is the future of computing. Eventually we'll get this right, but you don't want to be a casualty along the way.</blockquote>
Also trust them with how much information you give them, and make sure you keep a backup.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[People ask me why I keep this site up and running - and have for so long. I don’t think it’s about ego - it’s more like a snapshot of who I am each time I sit down to write. Everything changes, all the time. We die each second, and are reborn as some one new. The ability to look backwards, and see who I was a week, a month or a year ago is an interesting exercise in self examination.

And, I look back at the people all over the world whose lives have touched mine, and I am truly thankful to be living in a time of such ubiquitous communication. Democracy, peace and freedom are fostered by discourse. As long as we keep talking, everything will turn out ok….]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Um - ok. not better then ever. This blog has had quite the interesting (in the chinese meaning) life. It started out years and years ago as a <a href="http://www.blogger.com">blogspot</a> site, and soon was moved to <a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress</a>. It then almost migrated to several other platforms, but ended up on <a href="http://mephistoblog.com/">Mephisto</a>. Well, we're back on Wordpress for the time being. Will we stay? Probably not, even tho I like all of the cool toys baked in.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I have have a couple of things published on Web App Scaling in the recent past. Here is a list:
<ol>
	<li><a href="http://www.engineyard.com/blog/2009/a-quick-primer-on-sharding-for-ruby-on-rails/">A Quick Primer On Sharding For Ruby On Rails</a>: I discuss application sharding techniques at a very high level.</li>
	<li><a href="http://railslab.newrelic.com/2009/02/04/greg-nokes-lead-technical-account-manager-engine-yard">Masters Interview at New Relic</a>: I talk about all kinds of scaling concepts.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.engineyard.com/docs/EY_Filesystem_Sharding_Tactics_and_Processes.pdf">Filesystem Sharding Tactics and Processes</a>: A look at how to shard filesystems. Many of the ideas can be used for sharding just about anything.</li>
</ol>
For those that do not know. I'd like to take a second and define sharding - even though I did not invent the term.  Sharding is taking a system and breaking it up into smaller pieces, each with their own dedicated resources, to improve performance. It's that simple.

Anyways, enjoy!]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I just ran across several articles (<a href="http://www.forbes.com/2009/06/24/encryption-rsa-privacy-technology-breakthroughs-ibm.html">Forbes</a>, <a href="http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Security/IBM-Uncovers-Encryption-Scheme-That-Could-Improve-Cloud-Security-Spam-Filtering-135413/">eWeek</a> and <a href="http://www.ashdowngroup.com/news/ibm-boost-cloud-computing-with-encryption-breakthrough-news-19238766">The Ashdown Group</a>) about IBM's announcement of a mathematical method for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption">homomorphic encryption</a>.

When we can implement this, the implications are huge. You will be able to process large amounts of encrypted data to find broad trends, with out knowing the contents of the encrypted files.
<blockquote>Charles Lickel, vice-president of IBM Software Research, said: "Fully homomorphic encryption is a bit like enabling a layperson to perform flawless neurosurgery while blindfolded, without later remembering the episode."</blockquote>
--<a href="http://www.ashdowngroup.com/news/ibm-boost-cloud-computing-with-encryption-breakthrough-news-19238766">The Ashdown Group</a>

One of the uses for this that I can see, is doing spam filtering on encrypted email, with out breaking the encryption. So you could broadly publish a private key, and allow everyone to use it - but not open yourself to spam.

Another use would be in large scale data analysis across encrypted and secure clouds. You could (as the cloud provider) mine data about performance from your entire cloud, with out violating any one users privacy.

Companies like Google who depend on relevant, targeted adds could use this to not intrude into your privacy but still deliver the same level of targeting.

Heck - this might be the silver bullet for digital money. People could carry an encrypted file with some digital money in it on a card, and when you swipe the card, the merchant can see if you have enough for the purchase with out seeing your balance.

Neat stuff!]]></content:encoded>
